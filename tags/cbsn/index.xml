And in a new CBSN poll, more than half of Americans, fifty three percent approve of the job he is doing. And seventy percent, whether they agree or not, he is doing exactly what he promised to do. That includes cutting spending. But how he is doing it is another matter. The president made E.M a kind of sheriff of DOGE, the Department of Government Efficiency, to downsize just about everything. Our poll found Americans evenly split over how much influence should have over government operations and spending. And a federal judge has blocked their access to a Treasury Bureau that, among other things, sends out government payments, including social security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s called the Bureau of Fiscal Service. And what they are looking for is what people in Washington have been looking for decades, waste, fraud and abuse. This quest is not new. The methods, however, are. President T has given the world’s richest man a temporary White House job and an ambitious order – audit the federal government agency by agency, expose waste and fraud. And if you have to infiltrate sensitive government databases, do it. N.S worked for Treasury Department for two years during the B administration. The Bureau of Fiscal Service distributes 1.3 billion dollars payments annually – things like social security checks. Medicaid reimbursements and federal grants. “I think fraud in the government is actually a really worthwhile cause to try to combat. The challenge is that it has literally nothing to do with what the Bureau of Fiscal Service does or what this Treasury payments ecosystem is. So, if you are on the hunt for that, you certainly don’t go here. That doesn’t sit in the Bureau of Fiscal Service. That sits at the agencies. The Treasury Department has told congress Musk’s associates cannot change any payments, that they have had so-called read-only access to the database. But those assurances have not been independently verified. There’s also a question about data security. The most private, sensitive data about American citizens all sits in the Bureau of Fiscal Service and the Treasury payments ecosystems.”&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 06.04.24</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-06.04.24/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jun 2024 20:12:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-06.04.24/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;President B’s aggressive new border restrictions take effect. The impact of this executive action will be immediate. Soon, US immigration officials will be authorized to deport large numbers of migrants without processing their asylum claims. The restrictions will stay effect until illegal crossings dip below fifteen hundred migrants a day and they will be triggered again if crossings spike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting tomorrow, most migrants who crossed the border illegally will not be allowed to seek US asylum or remain in the US. They will be sent back to Mexico or their home country, and this will continue until illegal crossings drop to a level we have not seen in years. Flanked by border officials and Democratic governors, President B announced sweeping restrictions to the decades old asylum system. The rate of illegal crossings has fallen from its peak last winter but remain historically high. And polls show immigration is a top issue for voters who consistently give D.T higher marks. But progressive in Congress argued that today’s move by B undermined American values and abandoned people fleeing violence and unstable conditions, while Republicans who have urged B to take executive action slammed him today for doing just that. The restrictions are sure to face legal challenges. The ACLU telling CBSN today “We intend to sue. A ban on asylum is illegal just as it was when T unsuccessfully tried it.” B insisted his approach is more humane than T’s. Joanna Williams runs the Kino Border initiative, serving migrants in Nogales, Mexico. People like Pedro Solis wait as long as eight months for an appointment to ask for asylum using a US government app, with no luck, many giving up. And today, Arizona lawmakers passed a proposal to ask voters on November whether to make crossing unlawfully from Mexico into the state a state crime.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 03.22.24</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.22.24/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Mar 2024 20:12:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.22.24/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We want to begin tonight with the shocking news that the Princess of Wales, C, just forty-two-year-old has been secretly battling cancer. In an emotional message filmed at Windsor Castle two days ago, the Princess revealed the news came as a surprise. Shed had major abdominal surgery in January. Then she spent two weeks in the hospital. Follow-up tests showed the cancer. The mother with young kids is currently in the early stage of chemotherapy treatment. The Palace did not share the type cancer. But after a tough couple of months. C says she is doing well and getting stronger. King C announced his own cancer diagnosis in February, which was diagnosed while he was undergoing treatment for an enlarge prostate. Well tonight, King C breaking his silence on K in a statement saying he is “so proud of C for her courage in speaking as she did”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A stunning public address about a very private matter following weeks of speculation about K’s wellbeing and whereabouts after that surgery back in January and the cruel conspiracy theories on social media especially after that family photo K had to apologize for badly photoshopping a couple of weeks ago. To the world, she is C, the Princess of Wales, but firstly, a forty-two-year-old, mother of three young children, which is why they timed the announcement to today’s Eastern break when the children were off school for a few weeks. Palace sources tell CBSN she has already begun the early stages of a course of preventative chemotherapy. They won’t say what type of cancer or exactly when she was diagnosed. And they’ve made clear they won’t be sharing that information. But it comes on the heals of K.C’s cancer announcement in early February. And she finished by adding there was another reason she wanted to share the news.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 03.20.24</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.20.24/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Mar 2024 20:12:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.20.24/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We want to begin tonight with the whiplash of federal court rulings over the Texas immigration law known as SB4. A US Court of Appeals blocked the sweeping law. This was just hours after the Supreme Court said it could go into effect. The Texas law gives local and state police the power to arrest and detain migrants to cross the border illegally. Immigration enforcement has for decades been the sole responsibility of federal authorities. And as you heard, Republican Texas Governor G.A has said the state has the right to defend itself against what he is calling an invasion. Now, President B opposes the Texas law and he actually landed in the state today for fund raisers. This challenge comes as a Texas bus company has put the brakes on transporting migrants to New York City after a lawsuit was filled by New York City. The mayor there, E.A, urged other bus companies to stop their trips too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight, one of Texas Governor G.A’s toughest border restriction policies is under scrutiny by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. Judges decided to hear the case this morning after the Supreme Court temporarily allowed SB4 to go into effect. Questions focused squarely on the merits of law. Texas’s solicitor general seemed to struggle to defend the law’s merit. While the court decides SB4’s fate, Texas Governor G.A remained steadfast. A’s action, busing migrants to Democrat-run cities also suffered a minor setback in New York, where after being sued by the city, at least one bus company has agreed to stop busing migrants from Texas to New York. With the law in limbo, El Paso County Sheriff Commander R.U added his deputies won’t make SB4 a priority.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 03.19.24</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.19.24/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Mar 2024 20:12:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.19.24/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We want to begin tonight with the ruling from the Supreme Court that allows a sweeping Texas immigration law to go into effect from now. In a six to three decision, the nation’s highest court said it won’t block the law known as SB4 that gives local and state police the power to arrest and detain migrants suspected of crossing the border illegally. The federal government has been the sole authority of immigration enforcement for decades and critics say this ruling is an affront to federal law. The case now heads back to the Court of Appeals to decide if it is constitutional or not. In the meantime, it’s a major victory for Texas and Republican Governor G.A. The White House said that they fundamentally disagree with the Supreme Court’s order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Razor wire and Texas National Guard troops along the US Mexico border reinforced tonight by the US Supreme Court. Now, Lone Star State sheriff and police departments can arrest, jail and judges can prosecute migrant accused of illegally entering the US. Texas Governor G.A, who’s been locked in a years-long fight with the federal government over border security last year signed what’s known as the SB4 law amid the historic increase in migrant border crossings. Today, he called the Supreme Court’s ruling a positive development. The White House sought to block the law and today said it’s another example of Republican officials politicizing the border while blocking real solutions. They called on Congress to pass bipartisan border security plan, currently being block in the House. The Supreme Court allowed the new law to take effect but it still faces challenge in lower federal court. Today, conservative justices B.K and A.C.B urged the appeals court to rule quickly. Liberal justices S.S and K.B.J questioned the law’s constitutionality and said it will upend the longstanding federal state balance of power and sow chaos.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 03.17.24</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.17.24/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Mar 2024 20:12:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.17.24/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight in New Mexico where authorities have captured a suspect accused of gunning down a state trooper Friday who tried to help the suspect. Thirty-three-year-old J.S is now in custody after authorities arrested him following a police pursuit and shootout Albuquerque. S was spotted by a gas station clerk which prompted an urgent manhunt this weekend and a chilling warning to communities to be on the lookout for the armed and dangerous suspected killer. CBSN has the latest details on S’s capture and his condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Mexico police say the suspect is in the hospital under guard after being shot during his arrest. Thirty-three-year-old J.S was captured after a foot chase and gunfire. Some of the bullets leaving him wounded. Investigators say S, seem in this police dashcam photo shot and killed New Mexico state police officer J.H when the patrolman responded Friday to reports of a driver with a flat tire on Interstate forty. According to authorities, the South Carolina resident then took off in the patrolman’s car before crashing and bailing. Police have also connected S to the death of paramedic P.M-F, whose body was found Friday in South Carolina. The white BMW S was driving belong to her. Now that S is under arrest. Police say they are focusing on finding anyone that may have helped him elude authorities.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 03.17.24</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.17.24/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Mar 2024 20:12:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.17.24/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We are going to begin tonight with D.T facing a cash crunch. The former president is on the brink of being forced to surrender some of his most valuable real estate properties to help pay that four hundred and fifty-four million dollars civil fraud judgment in New York. He has already admitted he doesn’t have the nearly half a billion dollars in cash. And today, his lawyers revealed that more than thirty firms that they were unable, or “unwilling” to accept the risk associated with such a large bond. The clock is now ticking with that bond due next week. It’s worth remembering the civil judgement stems from the ruling that T falsely valued parts of his real estate empire for financial game. Then, on the campaign trail, T is also defending himself after a series of disturbing remarks about migrants, January 6th defendant, and warning of a quote “bloodbath” if he loses in November. It was all while discussing tariffs on Chinese-made cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former President D.T could soon be facing a financial crisis. His lawyers today revealing in a court filing that T has failed to obtain a four hundred- and fifty-four-million-dollar bond calling it “a practical impossibility”. It’s due in just one week and without it, New York Attorney General L.J could freeze his bank accounts and seize his prize properties including T Tower and Forty Wall Street. T, who was unable to reach agreement with more than thirty companies that provide appeal bonds, is also scrambling to raise money for the general election. CBSN has learned T is considering enlisting his former 2016 campaign chairman P.M, a convicted felon who was found guilty of committing several financial crimes in 2018 and later pardon by T. Meanwhile, the former president has ramped up his incendiary rhetoric on the campaign trail. T insists he was referencing a bloodbath in the automobile industry. In the past, T has warned of bedlam if B wins, suggesting there will be anger if he is convicted a crime. Over the weekend, T also referred to migrants as animals and described those convicted for crimes related to January 6th as hostages and patriots. That remark drawing criticisms from both sides of the aisle.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 03.16.24</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.16.24/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Mar 2024 20:12:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.16.24/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We are following several big stories tonight including the latest from the Middle East. But we begin in New Jersey, where an hours-long standoff between police and a murder suspect has just ended. It unfolded this morning with a series of shootings that left three dead in suburban Philadelphia. Police have named the suspect as A.G. G then barricaded himself inside a home a few miles away with hostages. A SWAT team managed to get them to safety. G surrendered to police. Among the dead, a thirteen-year-old girl. All victims are believed to be known to the suspect. Now to the latest Israel-Hamas war. Today, a US Air Force C-130 flew over Gaza’s coast, making it the twelfth American airdrop and food supply mission to the besieged territory. This as the UN warns that an alarming number of children in Gaza are suffering from the most severe form of starvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people of Gaza are contending with escalading war in hunger as aid into the besieged enclave cannot arrive fast enough. Israel insists it’s putting zero limits on aid getting into the war zone instead blaming groups like the UN over lack of personnel to move it where it’s most badly needed. That’s why additional aid is on its way by sea. For the first time in this war, more than one hundred tons from Europe arrived Friday on a humanitarian ship. But that’s not slowing down Israel’s potential ground assault on the southern city of Rafa which Prime Minister N is now approved despite warnings from the B administration. The assault itself is believed to be at least weeks away, unless there is a ceasefire in exchange for hostages held by Hamas. Israeli protesters we met today are furious calling N to step down over his handling of the war and its failure to save those abducted more than five months ago. About one hundred are believed to still be alive including several Americans. To get them back, sources at the ceasefire talks in Doha tell CBSN that Hamas is now demanding a release of up to one thousand Palestinian prisoners and a pause in fighting. Israel says so far that is unrealistic.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 03.15.24</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.15.24/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Mar 2024 20:12:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.15.24/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We’ll have more on that deadly storm and the widespread damage in seven states in a moment. But first, breaking news, with a wave of political developments revolving around former President D.T. Just over a week ago before it set to begin, a New York judge has delayed T’s first criminal case for thirty days. T faces thirty-four felony counts for falsifying business records related to payments to adult film star S.D. Plus, in a significant ruling in Georgia’s election interference case against the former president, a Fulton County judge has decided the District Attorney F.W can continue to prosecute that case, but blasted W for what he called a quote “tremendous lapse in judgement” for having a romantic relationship with one of her top prosecutors. That special prosecutor has now withdrawn from the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not just this new delay in the New York case, but this election case here in Georgia has effectively been put on hold, until today’s ruling by a judge effectively clearing District Attorney F.W to proceed. Fulton County Judge S.M gave District Attorney F.W an ultimatum today, either step aside from 2020 election subversion case, or have her former romantic partner, Special Prosecutor N.W, withdraw. Within hours, W tendered his resignation, effective immediately, to move this case forward. The former president hailed the move on Truth Social, calling W a “disgrace”.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 03.14.24</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.14.24/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Mar 2024 20:12:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.14.24/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with more than forty million Americans under threat from two major storm systems. Heavy snow is falling across the Rockies with three feet already on the ground in parts of Colorado causing travel nightmares at the airports and on the roads. Hundreds of flights at Denver International Airport were canceled today. And more severe and dangerous weather is sweeping across the middle of the country today, with several tornadoes touching down in Kentucky and Indianna. This funnel cloud was spotted over a small town in Kentucky. Communities are surveying the aftermath with downed trees and severely damaged homes and businesses. Now, that same system is moving east, with more than a dozen states under severe weather threats tonight from Dallas to Indianapolis with thunderstorms damaging hail and more tornadoes in the forecast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight, the severe storm threat keeps growing in the Midwest with multiple tornadoes touching down in Indianna. In Hanover, tornado ripped through homes causing roofs to collapse, knocking down trees and powerlines. In Madison, another tornado crossed the Ohio River. Video shows debris spinning in the air. In Milton, Kentucky, at least one hundred structures were damaged after a tornado touched down. Last night, a supercell thunderstorm spun up a tornado, as severe weather moved through all Alta Vista, Kansas. Hail battered northern Kansas. Some hails bigger than Golf balls. In Colorado, record-breaking snowfall is the problem.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 03.12.24</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.12.24/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Mar 2024 20:12:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.12.24/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We want to begin tonight with that firestorm in Capitol Hill. The former Special Counsel R.H testifying about his investigation into President B’s handling of classified documents. The Special Counsel was defiant, standing by his conclusion that no charges were warranted. You may call, though, it was his final report that angered the White House. The report included personal assessments about the president’s age and memory mentioning his son B’s death. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle used the hearing to score political points ahead of the 2024 presidential election. Republican blasted H for not charging B with a crime while Democrats aim to point out the differences between the current president and D.T who is facing charges for mishandling classified documents saying T obstructed all investigations. The White House views the matter as over and said the case is closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former special counsel R.H’s public grilling today at times looked more like a proxy fight for the White House. Republicans raised questions about President B’s mental fitness while Democrats aired unflattering footage of former President D.T. H defended his report and his contention that the president was a well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory. Democrats said he went too far. H questioned the president for five hours of two days in October and wrote that the president forgot key dates when his son, B, died. But a two hundred fifty-eight transcript of the interview released today shows the president remembered the month and day just not the year. After the report released last month, the president blasted H. Several Republicans accused H of letting the president off easy. In the hearing, Democrats also repeatedly called out the differences between the B and T documents cases. The current president had roughly eighty documents in his possession although the former president had more than three hundred. H had also acknowledged in his report that there are major differences in the cases.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 03.10.24</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.10.24/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Mar 2024 20:12:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.10.24/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with a sharp escalation in the public rift between President B and Israeli Prime Minister B.N. This weekend, the president took direct aim at N’s war strategy in Gaza and, N pushed back. The war in Gaza grinding on two million Palestinians marking the start of the holy month of Ramadan, no ceasefire between Hamas and Israel and a quarter of the population facing starvation. Prime Minister B.N said that the president was wrong on both counts as it relates to him not having the support of the Israeli people on the nation’s interests and its policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Israel intends to move forward into southern Gaza, a refuge for millions, as the president warns of a red line that should not be crossed. President B not mincing his words, criticizing Israeli Prime Minister B.N and calling for Israel’s war with Hamas to come to a ceasefire as humanitarian support by plane and by sea heads to the region. The World Food Program is warning that a quarter of the population in Gaza is one step away from famine. The intensity of Israel’s attacks haven’t slowed. On Friday night, a blistering airstrike hit one of the tallest building in Gaza, home to nearly three hundred families who were only given thirty minutes to evacuate. Lawmakers are split. Some critical of Israel’s tactics others of B’s condemnation of N. The crisis in the Middle East is also remain focus on the campaign trail. Both B and D.T rallied in Georgia on Saturday with the former president using his stump to sound off on his successor.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 03.09.24</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.09.24/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Mar 2024 20:12:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.09.24/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;As we come on the air, dueling rallies in Georgia, a key battleground state. The B and T campaigns now pivoting toward their general election rematch. But first tonight, more issues for United Airlines. Another mid-air diversion today, this one in Chicago. The problem? An oil warning light. On Friday night, this United Airbus made an emergency landing at LAX because of hydraulics issue. For the airline, two disruptive incidents in the last twenty-four hours and six in the last week. And while no one was hurt, it is part of a pattern of problems taking flight in commercial aviation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been a tough week for United Airlines and its passengers. Six different jetliners have had problems, some forced to make emergency landings, including one late Friday here at LAX. The plane was United Airbus A320, with 110 people on board. It was headed from San Francisco to Mexico City but forced to land here after the crew reported a hydraulics issue. Everyone got off safely. It was one of six plane problems for United just this week. This jet slid off taxiway Friday while landing in Houston. Also, a wheel fell off a 777 on takeoff in San Francisco Thursday. On Monday, two more incidents including this midair engine fire. In a statement, United described these incidents as distinct and unrelated to one another. United isn’t alone with problems. An American Airlines jet in Miami clipped the tail of a parked Frontier jet. Today, a new development in this near-disaster when an Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 Max 9 lost its so-called door plug in the air. The Justice Department now launching a criminal investigation. Still, this flier today not worried yet about airline safety.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 03.07.24</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.07.24/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Mar 2024 20:12:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.07.24/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;President B is about to leave the White House to head to Capitol Hill to deliver critical address to the nation before what may be the largest TV audience he’ll get this election season. It’s a chance for the Commander and Chief to reframe the political debate about not only the state of this country, but also his stewardship of it. Earlier today, I went to the White House for a conversation with the President about what he will talk about. He is eager to engage politically with Republicans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the president engages with Republicans, he plans to call out how they’ve lost elections for supporting the repeal of Roe versus Wade of promise to sign a federal law protecting access to abortion services if it’s ever passed. President is also planning to take at least a few jabs at his likely Republican opponent D.T. President has spent the past year touting a strong economy. But polls show most voters aren’t feeling it. Inflation, though down in recent months, has soared on his watch. Tonight, he will use his state of the union to push Congress to cap out-of-pocket drug costs at two thousand dollars a year for Americans with private health insurance and to restore the expanded child tax credit for low-and middle-income families. The president also plans to touch on immigration, an area where he is vulnerable and under constant attack by former president D.T. The number of migrants crossings spiked to more than 2.4 million in the last fiscal year, compared to under a million at a similar point in the T presidency. B’s own allies have criticized his handling of the Israel-Hamas war, the rising death toll in Gaza. Thousands voted against him for that reason in recent Democratic primaries. Tonight, the president will announce the US military is set to build a temporary port along the coast of Gaza to help deliver humanitarian aid. White House officials say the president is also expected to draw contrast with T, especially on the subject of reproductive rights with IVF patients and fertility doctors expected in the audience. Since the repeal of Roe versus Wade, thirteen more states have approved complete bans on abortion services.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 03.07.24</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.07.24/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Mar 2024 20:12:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.07.24/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with a series of tens of tense moments for a US airline just as spring break travel is getting underway. With tens of millions of passengers expected to fly over the next six weeks, it is raising safety concerns for some travelers. The latest incident took place today at George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston when a United flight veered off the runway after landing. The nearly one hundred and seventy people onboard were forced to depart the plane using airstairs on the open runway after the plane ended up in the grass. Fortunately, no one is injured. It’s the fourth such mishap involving a passenger jet this week alone including yesterday’s United flight that lost a wheel during takeoff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;United Airlines flight 2477 rolled off the runway moments after landing at Houston’s Bush airport this morning, leaving skid marks and ending up stuck in the mud with its nose up in the air. Social media video shows passengers evacuating the Boeing 737 Max 8 plane. One hundred and sixty passengers and six crew members were on board the flight from Memphis. The incident comes as Spring Break travel season takes off with United Airlines alone expecting more than twenty-one million passengers. It has been a turbulent week for air travel. On Monday, an engine on another United Boeing 737 burst into flames after bubble wrap was sucked into it. And yesterday, a wheel fell off another United plane, after the Boeing 777 took off from San Francisco, damaging at least two cars on the ground. Also on Thursday, American Airline’s flight was pushing back in Miami when it clipped the tail of a parked Frontier Jet.

Well, tonight could be the kick off to the 2024 general election and an ultimately rematch between J.B and D.T. And that will be the first time in more than one hundred years that a president faces off against a former president. Polls have just closed in Minnesota, Colorado, and Texas, but polls are still open in three of today’s fifteen contests including California. But millions of votes are still to be counted. CBSN projects that former President D.T will win the Republican primary in Texas. That’s one of the biggest prizes today. And T has won nine states so far tonight on his way to capturing the Republican nomination. We do want to focus on Vermont for just a moment, which is shaping up to be the closest race of the GOP primary today. With more than half the votes counted, the race is still considered a tossup. President continues his march to the Democratic nomination, winning every state where CBSN can make a projection. As for the voters, CBSN exit polls show that immigration and the economy are the top issues for Republicans with many feeling angry about how things are going in this country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the ballroom is feeling up behind me here at T’s headquarters. This Super Tuesday may have been less suspenseful than in years pass, but it is no less consequential likely setting the stage for a rematch between the former and the current presidents while also perhaps signaling an end to N.H’s campaign. As voters across the country cast ballots today, D.T is aiming for a Super Tuesday sweep to force his last remaining rival N.H out of the race. Despite winning just one contest so far in the District of Columbia, H had vowed to stay in the running at least through today when Republican voters in fifteen states have their say. A massive delegate haul won’t be enough for T to officially clinch the nomination. That could come as soon as next week. But it could solidify his dominance in the Republican party even as he faces ninety-one charges in four criminal cases. In North Carolina, exit poll showed that sixty-four percent of Republican voters say T is fit to be president if convicted of a crime. Those cases have helped to his support among Republicans though some supporters told us, they want him to temper his rhetoric. On the Democratic side, President B is also expected to run the table. But he is aiming to stave off an opponent of his own. Voters in seven states will have the option to vote uncommitted which some Democrats hope registers opposition to the president’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 03.04.24</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.04.24/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Mar 2024 20:12:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.04.24/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We want to begin tonight with the news and analysis of that historic decision from the Supreme Court. The justices ruling that states cannot bar D.T from running for another term. Even though he is accused by some of insurrection. Colorado and several other states were seeking to disqualify T because of his actions surrounding the January 6th attack on the US Capitol. And today’s decision was unanimous. All nine justices agreed that T cannot be barred from the ballot in perhaps the most important ruling by the nation’s highest court about a presidential election in more than two decades since the decision of Bush versus Gore in 2000. This is the key paragraph of the ruling “States may disqualify persons holding or attempting to hold state office. But States have no power under the Constitution with respect to federal offices, especially the presidency”. Now, the court’s three liberal members say the court’s majority went too far. Justices S.S, E.K, K.B.J expressed frustration in a concurring opinion saying the decision protects D.T from “future controversy”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A crucial decision today with sweeping political consequences. The high court ruling that former President D.T cannot be removed from Colorado’s ballot due to the state court’s view that he stoked January 6th insurrection. With this ruling, two other states also had their efforts to remove the former president stall. Three justices, in a separate concurring opinion said allowing Colorado measure to go forward “would, we agree, create chaotic state-by-state patchwork”. Amid a tense political landscape, Justice A.C.B also urged Americans to see unity from the unanimous decision, writing “in this circumstance, writings on the Court should turn the national temperature down, not up.” Colorado Democratic Secretary of State offered sharp criticism of the decision. The ruling comes a day before Super Tuesday, the biggest primary election day of the season, when voters in fifteen states, including Colorado, head to the polls. And T’s legal hurdles continue to pile up, as the Supreme Court weighs another decision next month.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 02.29.24</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.29.24/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Mar 2024 20:12:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.29.24/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We have several major stories that we are following tonight including that massive blizzard out west. Plus, President B’s biggest announcement for Gaza as hundreds of thousands are under threats of starvation. But we begin tonight with new developments in that terrifying accident and dramatic rescue in Louisville when a semi-truck was left dangling off a bridge nearly one hundred feet over the Ohio River. The driver miraculously escaped without suffering any series injuries but was taken to a local hospital out of precaution. And we are hearing from the incredibly brave rescuers who say they are trained to this kind of thing all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High drama above the Ohio River, like a scene from a Tom Cruise thriller. A tractor trailer dangling from the Clark Memorial Bridge and a repelling firefighter trying to pluck its female driver to safety. That’s Louisville firefighter B.C repelling to rescue the driver. Both of them hovering about seven feet above the water connecting Kentucky and Indianna. The semi had crashed through the guardrail after a four-vehicle accident. The driver trapped in the cab about forty minutes. C slowly, carefully, guided them both back over the guardrail to safety. The semi has now been pulled back onto the bridge which remains close in both directions.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 02.28.24</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.28.24/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Feb 2024 20:12:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.28.24/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We do want to begin tonight with the dueling visits at the southern border. The two frontrunners in this year’s election, showcasing the record number of migrant crossings that are overwhelming resources along the border and in major cities across the country. President B was in Brownsville, Texas where he issued a political dare to D.T to join him in pressing House Republican to secure the border by passing the Senate’s bipartisan security bill. Now three hundred and twenty-five miles away, T was in Eagle Pass where he took a much different approach unleashing attacks on B, Democrats and migrants but not proposing a legislative solution. A record 2.4 million migrants were apprehended at the US-Mexican border in 2023 and immigration has become the top issue for many voters heading into the 2024 election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The president, and the former president who wants to replace him in the White House played the blame game today along the US-Mexico border. President B said it was D.T who urged Republicans to kill the bill that would have beefed up the security. After a record number of illegal crossing last year, President B toured the border in Brownsville, Texas, is trying to show he is addressing an issue that more than sixty percent of voters call a very serious concern. But C.C of the border patrol said that with illegal crossing into this part of Texas down recently, the president has come too late. T, who visited Eagle Pass, more than three hundred miles away, continue to exploiting a crisis that he couldn’t solve either, hoping it will put him back in the White House. Allies say he is planning mass deportations and detention camps if elected. Today, he sought to falsely connect President B to the recently murder of a Georgia nursing student by a Venezuela migrant, who entered the country illegally in 2022. The president, who didn’t address T’s attacks, said they should work together. As president, T severely restricted asylum and required migrants await their court hearings in Mexico. When President B took office, he revered those policies but is now considering employing executive power used by T to suspend asylum. The former President also met with Texas Governor G.A today, who is at war with B administration for implementing his own border crackdown, installing National Guard troops and razor wire barriers in Eagle Pass.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 02.27.24</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.27.24/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Feb 2024 20:12:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.27.24/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We want to begin tonight with that major news from the US Supreme Court. The justices agreeing to consider whether D.T must stand trial over charges he plotted to overturn the 2020 presidential election. The former president has claimed that he is entitled to absolute immunity because he was president at the time, while a lower court has rejected that. And today, we’ve learned that the highest court in the land acknowledging the historic importance of this case will hear arguments the week of April 22th. That’s a little less than two months from now. And this sets the stage for a landmark ruling on presidential power. Just to give you some context, that week that the court will hear these arguments, D.T is expected to be sitting in a New York City courtroom for the criminal trial related to his alleged hush money payments to the porn star, S.D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today’s decision means we can expect a blockbuster ruling by this summer, a ruling that could upend the 2024 election. The Supreme Court set the stage for landmark arguments in two months. Its order tonight says it will hear the arguments the week of April 22th into “whether and if so to what extent does a former president enjoy a presidential immunity from criminal prosecution for conduct alleged to involve official acts during his tenure in office”. The decision delays indefinitely the trail involving T’s efforts to overturn 2020 election. With a Supreme Court decision not expected until May or June. It could endanger chance to hold the trial here in Washington before the 2024 election. T faces four felony charges including conspiracy and obstruction, for allegedly plotting to defy voters and hold on to power. And Special Counsel J.S has argued T used the riotous attack on the Capitol by his supporters as a further tool to do so. His appeal claims he is immune from prosecution because the alleged acts were official act he took while he was president. It was rejected promptly by Judge T.C who said “presidents don’t have get-out-of-jail-free cards”. Then it was rejected again this month by a Washington DC, appeals court. Though it was rejected, the argument has succeeded in delaying this trail. The arguments that the Supreme Court set for the week of April 22th, that’s the week projected jury deliberations in the T’s DC trial.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 02.26.24</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.26.24/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Feb 2024 20:12:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.26.24/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We are following a number of developing stories but we do want to begin tonight with that breaking news and that first look at the shocking bodycam video from the shooting at celebrity pastor J.O’s Houston church. The disturbing video shows people, including children running from gunfire as heroic officers ran towards the gunshots. The audio is startling. You can hear the barrage echoing off the walls and sealing of the nearly seventeen thousand-seat megachurch. Two off duty officers were working security at the church when the shooting began. They killed the thirty-six-year-old woman, who was armed with an assault style rifle. Her seven-year-old son who she brought with her onto the scene, remains in critical condition with a gunshot wound to the head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight, we’re hearing for the first time the sounds of terror inside a place of worship. Explosions of gunfire as a woman threatened authorities inside televangelist J.O’s Lakewood Church. Houston police releasing bodycam video of off-duty law enforcement officers who ran into the face of danger two weeks ago, taking down the woman who came into the church with a rifle and her seven-year-old son. She was killed, he was shot in the head but the danger remained. Officials say they decided to release these videos for transparency. Amid the horror, there was humanity. This officer trying to comfort the badly wounded seven-year-old, with chaos all around. Tonight, that boy is still fighting for his life two weeks after the shooting here at Houston Church. Authorities have not confirmed whether he was struck by gunfire from the security officers responded, saying it remains an active investigation.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 02.25.24</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.25.24/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Feb 2024 20:12:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.25.24/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, former President D.T has his eye set on Michigan this Tuesday for what he hopes to be another win after sweeping the primaries thus far. His challenger N.H is defying calls to drop out. At last check, her campaign says she is planning to head to the Great Lakes State after suffering a major blow and the very place that elected her twice as Governor. Well, here are the numbers with nearly all the votes counted T won South Carolina by about twenty points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another decisive win for former President D.T. For the GOP front-runner, it’s also another hurdle cleared in that long road to securing one thousand two hundred and fifteen delegates needed to clinch the Republican nomination. In Columbia, South Carolina, former President D.T declare victory, sweeping his fourth straight primary by double digits. Leaving his opponent, former South Carolina Governor N.H and her home state advantage thwarted. Roughly eight hundred thousand South Carolinians voted Saturday. T bested H among most key demographic groups winning majorities of both men and women plus all aged groups according to CBSN exited polls. Michigan is just one of a dozen Super Tuesday states voting on March 5th. Now, H has vowed to stay in the race until then, when over one third of the Republican delegates will be awarded.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 02.24.24</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.24.24/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Feb 2024 20:12:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.24.24/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin with breaking political news from South Carolina. CBSN projects D.T will win state’s Republican primary. This marks the fourth win for the former president having already swept contest in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada in the Republican race for president. T’s victory a particularly painful loss for opposing candidate N.H because this is her home turf having previously served as governor of Palmetto State. She voted with her family today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former President T is already looking to the January election. Former Ambassador N.H said today she stay in the race, win or lose South Carolina. But T already taking about, taking over the Republican National Committee and installing his allies as he looks toward November. Her donors’ official tells me she has an uphill climb ahead but she still believes there is coalition out there. We don’t believe former President T can win so she stays in this race even though she keeps losing because she also knows T has so many legal challenges on the horizon and anything can happen.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 02.23.24</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.23.24/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Feb 2024 20:12:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.23.24/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;There is breaking news tonight in the trial of the National Rifle Association’s former long time leader W.L after he was accused of using the gun lobbying group as a personal piggy bank. We’ll get to that news in just a minute. But we do want to begin with the future of reproductive rights here in America. And the growing backlash to that Alabama Supreme Court decision that declared embryos should be treated as children. A growing number of conservative Republicans are speaking out against the ruling. There are also a number of developments in Alabama that have possible nationwide implications. One of the country’s largest embryo shipping companies saying today they’ve reportedly paused doing businesses in Alabama and that means many of the people who hope to continue their treatment out of state have lost their option. Also, the Alabama attorney general, for his part, announced today he has no intention of prosecuting IVF clinics or its patients. Now this all comes just ahead of the key Republican primary vote tomorrow in South Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Republican primary frontrunner, former President D.T said he strongly supports the availability of IVF. As former UN Ambassador N.H aims for a breakthrough in her home state, a national reckoning over the Alabama Supreme Court’s ruling on in-vitro fertilization is upending the final hours of the South Carolina primary. The debate over Alabama’s decision is now putting 2024 battleground Republican candidates in political crosshairs, causing the campaign arm of the Senate to encourage Republican Senate candidates to clearly and concisely reject efforts by the government to restrict IVF. But amid the fallout and intense push for votes in South Carolina, for the last two Republicans presidential candidates. Top Republicans tell CBSN they are urging H to stay in the race as long as possible in case T is convicted in the criminal hush money case set to begin next month in New York. In the meantime, her supporters are weighing their options if she were to drop out.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 02.22.24</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.22.24/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Feb 2024 20:12:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.22.24/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with that nationwide AT&amp;amp;T outage that left a lot of people scratching their heads under what is going on leading to confusion and concern about the ability to dial 911. The ripple effect inundating emergency centers from New York to Los Angeles. AT&amp;amp;T tonight is apologizing but they are not explaining what happened. The FBI, the FCC and the Department of Homeland Security are now investigating the calls. And the White House says there is no evidence that a malicious attack was behind the network shutdown. But there are still so many questions. The outage also highlighting concerns about how the lack of communications could impact us all in a real emergency, and renewing concerns about cyber security in the US. The top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee tonight has a dire warning, saying a Chinese cyber attack would be one hundred times worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A rude awakening for tens of thousands of AT&amp;amp;T customers. From Chicago to Dallas, Boston to Los Angeles, more than seventy-four thousand users reported widespread problems. Late today, AT&amp;amp;T apologized to customers and said service had been fully restored. Nearly three quarters of adults live in households with a landline, so losing cell service is a disaster can cripple communications. But today’s outage inundated the emergency call centers with people dialing them up to test their phones. Massachusetts State Police posting that many emergency centers were flooded with calls. And in San Francisco, the FBI is in contact with AT&amp;amp;T and the FCC is actively investigating.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 02.21.24</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.21.24/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Feb 2024 20:12:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.21.24/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We want to begin tonight with shockwaves being felt in the world of reproductive health care following a bombshell IVF ruling by Alabama’s Supreme Court. In Friday’s unprecedented decision, the all-Republican court ruled that frozen embryos are the legal equivalent of children. Now, Alabama’s largest hospital is pausing all in-vitro fertilization treatments as healthcare providers across the state and country evaluate what this means. The ruling could have a devastating effect for people who desperately want to have children in a state that already has one of the nation’s strictest abortion laws. The decision may also make the already expensive cost of infertility skyrocket because of rising liability costs. To understand the possible impact, look at these numbers from the CDC. Nearly one hundred thousand babies were born in the US in 2021 using IVF treatments. That’s more than 2% of all births.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirty-four-year-old J.Y turned to IVF to get pregnant, but now her dream of having another child has come to a sudden halt. This morning, Y got a phone call from her fertility doctor at the University of Alabama with the news. The hospital system is pausing all IVF treatments while it takes closer look at the state’s Supreme Court’s ruling that frozen embryos are consider people. In a statement to CBSN, the University of Alabama says it is saddened, “but we must evaluate the potential that our patients and our physicians could be prosecuted criminally or face punitive damages following the standard of care for IVF treatments”.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 02.20.24</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.20.24/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Feb 2024 20:12:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.20.24/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We do want to begin tonight with that breaking news with new arrest in the deadly mass shooting in the Kansas City Chief Super Bowl celebration. Missouri prosecutors charged two men, both in the hospital recovering from gunshot wounds with murder in the shooting that killed a woman and injured twenty others. Police say the incident started with a verbal argument, quickly escalating and one of the suspects pulled a gun and began firing. Two juveniles were also detained on gun-related and charges and resisting arrest last week. Prosecutors say there could be even more arrests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The celebration of Kansas City Super Bowl victory is just the latest public event to be marred by gunfire across the US. Tonight, new charges in the deadly shooting that broke out during the celebration for the Kansas City Chief Super Bowl win. D.M of Kansas City and L.M of Raytown, Missouri now face charges of second-degree murder, armed criminal action and unlawful use of a weapon. Both men were also among the nearly two dozen shot during the chaos. The shooting happened when an estimated one million people were gathered to celebrate the Chief’s Super Bowl victory. Shots were fired near the west side Union Station near the stage. Charging documents say there was an altercation between the suspects who were both armed and that it was M who fired the fatal shot that killed L.G. And tonight, the suspects are being held on a million-dollar bond. The new charges filed today are in addition to the charges filed last week against two juveniles.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 02.19.24</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.19.24/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Feb 2024 20:12:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.19.24/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with nearly all of California under the threat of dangerous weather alert, with yet another atmospheric river slamming the West Coast. Torrential rains, snow, damaging winds and possible tornadoes are expected in this multi-state storm, bringing threats of severe flooding and mudslides. Flashflood warnings are in effect for parts of Los Angeles County, while residents in the Santa Monica mountains and Hollywood Hills have been warned to be ready to evacuate due the possibility mud and debris flood. This is the second batch of storms to hit the region in recent weeks, leaving little time for rain-soaked hillsides to dry out. California’s Office of Emergency Services pre-positioned equipment and rescue crews in counties as this storm moves to the shore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This atmospheric river is delivering another crashing blow to California. The overnight deluge made driving on road treacherous in Sacramento and the Bay Area, resulting in spinouts and close calls. The state’s central coast has already been inundated with more than six inches of rain in some areas. This is what Santa Barbara’s looked like today, it was shut down. And pinned under nearby rushing waters, a gruesome discovery. Right now, a swift rescue team is recovering a body from the water over there. It’s not clear if this is a weather-related death but the body certainly came down this stream. The storms brought down trees and part of this hillside along US 101 near the Oregon border. Farther south in Ventura County, firefighters shoveled mud and stacked sandbags to divert water from homes and streets. But even cleanup crews wound up getting stuck.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 02.18.24</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.18.24/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Feb 2024 20:12:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.18.24/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, flags in Minnesota have been lower to half-staff honoring two police officers and a paramedic shot and killed today. It happened after hours-long standoff with the gunman in the Minneapolis suburb of Burnsville after a domestic abuse call. Another officer was wounded. Governor T.W called it “horrific”, adding, “we must never take for granted the bravery and sacrifices of our police and first responders”. Tonight, a solemn procession as the bodies of the slain officers and paramedic were moved from a Minneapolis hospital in preparation for their funerals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is now been almost twelve hours that officers are here in this neighborhood. You see behind me, still a very active scene. Investigators, detectives looking for answers about what led up to this shooting. The call for paramedics came shortly after 5 this morning. Minutes later, dispatcher ordered everyone to stay back. First responders rushed to the home in Burnsville, a suburb about twenty minutes outside Minneapolis. They said an armed man was barricaded inside along with his family. As police arrived, the man opened fire. Video shows at least one SWAT vehicle with its windshield nearly shattered by bullets. Two twenty-seven-year-old officers from the Burnsville Police Department were struck and killed. A paramedic who rushed to the aid of one of them, also died in the shootout. State investigators confirmed the suspect died in the confrontation with police. However, family members in the home made it out safely. And again, a third officer struck by gunfire. He was rushed to the hospital, but the good news tonight, he is expected to make a full recovery.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 02.17.24</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.17.24/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Feb 2024 20:12:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.17.24/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, a new storm is set to drench California again raising fears of the floods and mudslides. The latest in a moment. But first, President B today forcefully reiterated support for Ukraine. Even as the country suffered a major lost in the battlefield against Russian forces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President B called Ukraine president today as Ukrainian soldiers were forced to withdraw from a key city. The White House says they are having to ration ammunition and blames congressional in action. Russian forces raised their flags in the eastern city of Avdiivka, what had been a Ukrainian stronghold and symbol of resistance since Russian invasion nearly two years ago. President B’s pledge comes as Ukrainian President V.Z appealed to world leaders at the Munich security conference. Vice President K.H emphasized unwavering US support even as the timing of more security assistance remains in question held up in the US House now on a nearly two-week recess. But it’s unclear if and when the House Speaker will take up the bipartisan foreign aid package pass this week in the Senate. N.H on a bus tour through South Carolina criticized former President T for interfering with congressional negotiations. And she questioned the GOP frontrunners’ ability to balance the campaign trail and courtroom. T appeared at a sneaker show in the battleground state of Pennsylvania one day after facing defeat in his New York civil fraud case has made his legal battle a rallying cry.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 02.16.24</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.16.24/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Feb 2024 20:12:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.16.24/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We’ll have more on the shocking news of A.N.’s death in just a moment. But first, we begin with some breaking news and historic ruling of in the civil fraud trial against former President D.T. A judge ordered T to pay more than three hundred fifty million dollars in penalties and bar him from serving as an officer or director of any New York company for three years. Today’s decision comes after he was liable for falsifying business records in order to get better terms on loans and insurance. It is major victory for New York state attorney general LJ, who first sued the former president back in 2022. Well, tonight T called the ruling “a total sham”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight, a potentially crushing blow to DT’s business empire and bank account. The former president ordered to pay more than three hundred fifty million dollars and banned from running business in New York or applying for loans in the state for three years. His two sons each fined four million dollars and barred from doing business in New York for two years thrusting the leadership of the family company into peril. T’s lawyer AH called the verdict “a manifest injustice” and said an appeal battle is coming. The former president reacted late today. In his ruling, judge AE said of T and the other defendants “their complete lack of remorse borders on pathological”. On T himself, who took the stand two times, the judge said his refusal to answer the question directly, or in some cases, at all, severely compromised his credibility.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 02.15.24</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.15.24/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Feb 2024 20:12:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.15.24/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We are learning new details about what lead to that mass shooting that turned Kansas City Chief’s Super Bowl parade from celebration to carnage. Police say it was not terrorism, but an argument between several people that resulted in an outburst of gunfire. The two people taken into custody are teenagers, criminal charges are expected tomorrow. One person was killed and twenty-two others injured and two of them remain in critical condition. We’re also learning the identity of the woman who died on the scene. Forty-three-years-old L.LG, she was a mother of two and a popular radio DJ. Her family described her as a big fan of the Chiefs. She was there celebrating the teams title with her husband and adult son. Police also want to speak with people who were in the area about what they saw and they’re asking to see any cellphone video from the rally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As investigators now process a massive crime scene, the people of Kansas City are trying to process how a family-friendly Super Bowl celebration destroy so many lives in an instant. L.LG, local radio personality, was there several family members. Her son was shot. She was killed. The shooting victims include nine children. The youngest, just eight years old. Police are tight-lipped about the two suspects still in custody. Video shows one person with a gun being tackled by a group. That weapon appears to be a semi-automatic rifle. This type of shooting now all too common. Sixty percent of mass shootings occur in everyday places, churches, theaters, grocery stores or at celebrations. Left behind, images of yet another community struggling to heal. This shooting has some communities and families questioning whether attending outdoor gathering are safe. Here at the Super Bowl parade, there were about eight hundred police officers for a million spectators. The mayor here in Kansas City vowing to move forward including hosting next month St. Patrick’s Day parade.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 02.14.24</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.14.24/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Feb 2024 20:12:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.14.24/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We want to begin with that breaking news. A mass shooting at the Super Bowl parade in Kansas City. The celebration for the Kansas City Chiefs turned into a nightmare. At least one person was killed, more than thirty others injured and includes two dozen people with gun shot wounds. Eight of those who were shot are children. The extent of their injuries is not yet known. Law enforcement sources tell CBSN this all may have started with an argument. There are now three people in custody. Nearly one million people were expected to gather along the parade route in Missouri with hundreds of law enforcement officials on hand. Fans are seen running for their lives as gunshots rang out just after the team finished speaking to the crowd. And there is video tonight of fans tackling someone believed to be one of the suspects. We can report that the FBI are on the scene and the president has been briefed. The Kanas City Chiefs says all of its players, coaches, and staff are safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the moment that the victory celebration turned violent. Gunfire, screams as the horrifying reality set fans, including families running for their lives. You can see first responders giving CPR and fans being loaded into onto stretchers. Eight hundred law enforcement officers were on site. Many running toward gunfire taking three suspects into custody. As all this unfolding, we were covering the celebration live. And you got kids and you got elderly people, you aren’t expecting something like this. People began to run as hard as they could in all directions. People knocked down; children knocked down.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 02.13.24</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.13.24/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Feb 2024 20:12:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.13.24/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin with the fast-moving nor’easter and the forty-five million Americans impacted from North Virginia to Massachusetts. In some places, fifteen inches of snow fell today alone, leading to dangerous road conditions, crashes, and many tonight are without power. More than a million students were out of school. New York City if digging out, and this is the biggest snowstorm since 2022. Snow-covered roads caused havoc during the morning commute causing more than one thousand and two hundred accidents in Pennsylvania alone. Air travelers faced their own problems with more than three thousand delays and cancelations at the nation’s airports. Well, tonight, the major concern is coastal flooding. More than eleven million along the shorelines are under alerts tonight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A near miss in the Northeast as the fast-moving storm dumped snow from Maryland to Massachusetts. New York City saw the highest daily snow total in more than two years just over three inches but far less than the eight that was predicted by the National Weather Service. Well, parts of Connecticut and Pennsylvania saw more than a foot of snow, the wintry white quickly turned slushy and slick, police responding more than a thousand accidents in Pennsylvania and hundreds more in New Jersey and Connecticut according to state police. Air travel was also a mess with thousands of interruptions and major airports including New York’s LaGuardia where more than a third flights were canceled. The Massachusetts Coast is under a flood advisory.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 02.12.24</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.12.24/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Feb 2024 20:12:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.12.24/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with the terrifying shooting at Joel Osteen’s megachurch in Houston. The church hosts nearly forty-five thousand worshippers weekly. Police tonight are searching for a motive trying to determine why thirty-six-year-old woman opened fire. Well, here is what we know, law enforcement says the suspect has a history of mental health problems, and they found antisemitism writings. Two people were injured, including the shooter’s seven-year-old son, who tonight is in critical condition. Two off-duty police officers are being held as heroes. They shot and killed the suspect within minutes likely preventing more bloodshed. Overseas now, two hostages are back with their families after Israeli troops stormed a heavily armed department in Southern Gaza and rescued them. It all happened in the city of Rafah which Israel says is the last remaining stronghold for Hamas terrorists. It is also where more than one million civilians who are trying to find shelter from the war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was an audacious mission. Under the cover of airstrikes, Israeli special forces swooped onto a second-floor apartment in Rafah. This morning, curious onlookers gathered at the scene, where soldiers have rappelled down ropes with hostages L.H and F.M as they exchanged heavy fire with Hamas fighters. The men, who are brothers-in-law, were taken to the hospital in Tel-Aviv for a longed-for reunion with their families. As the fighting wraps up in Rafah, family members urged hostage negotiators to do everything they can to bring the remaining captives back home.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 02.10.24</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.10.24/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Feb 2024 20:12:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.10.24/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, negotiations over next phase of US funding for conflicts in Ukraine and Israel remain on the brink. And Senators work through the weekend on a package. This latest push follows the collapse of bipartisan talks over sweeping legislation on border security and foreign aid and as allies in Europe pressured the US to step in as Ukraine faces more turmoil as the country’s top general was replaced this week. Overnight, at least seven people, including three children died after a Russian drone strike in a residential neighborhood in Kharkiv. Fire crews fought flames that local authorities say destroyed several homes. And in the Middle East, there is tension between the US and Israel, with the war in Gaza expanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1.4 million Palestinians seeking shelter in Rafah are been given several options by Israel that can move to another part of Rafah, go to Khan Younis, which is still regularly bombed or returned to the north which has been all but obliterated. This was supposed to be the last stop, this woman fled with her family from Khan Younis to stay with her sister in Rafah. But the home she saw refuge in was among those hit in an Israeli airstrike, her sister was killed along with eleven others including five children. After more than four months of war. The tanks of those displaced go on for miles. Fear and despair are rising. The choice is stark, stay or run, either way risking death. The north of Gaza is one area Israel has suggested people return to. Rafah is not just the last refuge, it’s also an entry point of humanitarian aid and where doctors are treating patients from all over Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 02.09.24</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.09.24/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Feb 2024 20:12:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.09.24/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;President B tonight is hitting back against the special counsel and the classified documents case. Even though no criminal prosecution was recommended, the White House says the report included “gratuitous and inappropriate criticism” when it comes to Mr. B’s age and memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight, the White House is doing damage control, defending President B’s mental fitness and accusing special counsel R.H once a T. appointee of taking partisan shots at the president. In the report, H. referred B’s memory at least nine times that it was “significantly limited” and appeared “hazy” that he had diminished faculties in advancing age and was a well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory. In a hastily called press conference Thursday night, the president was visibly frustrated and became emotional over H’s mention that he could not remember when his son B. died. He insisted his memory was fine, but at one point President B confused the leaders of Egypt and Mexico. Some fellow Democrats say Mr. B’s attempt to defend himself fell short. Former President T did not comment on the report at his rally Thursday. He, too, has faced questions about cognitive decline, recently mixing up N.P and rival N.H when discussing January 6th. H has blasted both men for being too old. In the wake of that special counsel report, President B plans to appoint a task force to review how classified material is handled to improve the process. He insists that he did not mishandle any classified material, blaming his staff for moving documents improperly.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 02.08.24</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.08.24/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Feb 2024 20:12:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.08.24/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We want to begin tonight with the blockbuster news about the two men who are expected to face off again in this year’s presidential election. Tonight, the dramatic testimony and questions at the Supreme Court about whether the Constitution, specifically the fourteenth amendment should bar D.T from being on the presidential ballot in several states. You could say that not since the 2000 Supreme Court decision of B. versus G. has the nation’s highest court taken such direct role in the outcome of a presidential election. President B, too, facing questions tonight about his handling of classified documents from his time as vice president and senator. The long-awaited Special Counsel report just released included pictures of classified Afghanistan documents found in a garage near a dog crate. And while there are no charges, the report says J.B disclosed classified materials when he was a private citizen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three hundred and forty-five-page special counsel report is critical of President B over his handling of highly classified documents including photos and records crammed into desk drawers, some in a damaged cardboard box in the garage at his Delaware home, others at former office in Washington DC. Special Counsel R.H writes that Mr. B’s conduct presented serious risk to national security. But H. decided not to bring criminal charges because the evidence does not establish Mr. B’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 02.07.24</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.07.24/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Feb 2024 20:12:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.07.24/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin our report on Capitol Hill, where not much is doing. The Senate failed to advance a bipartisan border policy and foreign aid package. Wednesday’s vote was mostly along party lines it would have set the stage for a floor debate on the measure but Senate Republicans were reluctant to move forward on a bill that House Republicans says has no chance of becoming law and so Congress has not addressed the issues. Negotiators spent months toiling over a southern border which saw a record number of migrants arrival in December. And support for Ukraine, which officials say Wednesday was hit by a Russian missile killing at least five people and wounding dozens more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As migrants continue to cross, Congress is frozen in place. A US Senate plan to stiffen border security, tighten requirements for asylum and nearly shutter the border during spikes of migrants crossing had the endorsement of Senate leaders and national border patrol union. But it collapsed in a vote late today in part because President T opposed it. The impasse is a blow also to cities like Chicago where A.B.L is helping the city respond to thousands of migrants bused from the border.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 02.06.24</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.06.24/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Feb 2024 20:12:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.06.24/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We want to begin tonight with the groundbreaking verdict against a Michigan mother whose teenage son killed four classmates in a school shooting in 2021. The jury of six women and six men found J.C guilty of four counts of involuntary manslaughter for allowing her trouble son access to a gun, despite warning signs of his declining mental health. This is noteworthy, because it’s the first time in the United States that a parent has been convicted in the deaths of a mass school shooting committed by their child. Prosecutors charged C with four counts, one for each of the four students killed at Oxford High School in Michigan in 2021. Well, tonight we are hearing from the jury foreperson for the first time about what sealed the mother’s fate. Her son E pleaded guilty and was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J.C closed her eyes at times as the decision was read. The jury foreperson said their decision came down into a single factor. It was November 2021 when C’s then fifteen-year-old son E shot and killed four students at Oxford High School. Seven other people were wounded. After the shooting C and her husband fled. They were found hiding in a Detroit industrial building as officers closed in. Prosecutors had argued C failed to address her son’s deteriorating mental health before the shooting, allowing him to have the gun despite signs that he was in mental distress. And refused to take her son home the day of the shooting after a school meeting to discuss disturbing drawings he made.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 02.05.24</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.05.24/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Feb 2024 20:12:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.05.24/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;But we want to begin with the surprising news from the royal family, Britain’s King C III announcing he has cancer and is already starting treatment. Just last week, the seventy-five years old monarch underwent treatment for an enlarged prostate. That procedure led to this separate discovery. The Palace statement said the king is revealing diagnoses to raise awareness for those impacted by cancer. But there are still so many big questions tonight about what type of cancer and how it advances it is. Today, the President of the United States campaigning in Las Vegas said he is concerned about King C’s diagnosis and hopes to speak with him soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the Palace says King C is resting at home tonight at Clarence House, his favored London residence just around the corner from here in Buckingham Palace. He remained positive and looks forward to returning to full public duty as soon as possible. King C was last seen public just yesterday, waving at well-wishers before attending church with Queen C in Sandringham. The revelation came just one week after the seventy-five-year-old king was discharged from the hospital where he underwent treatment for a benign enlarged prostate. During that procedure, the Palace says a separate issue of concern was noted “Subsequent diagnostic tests have identified a form of cancer”. “His Majesty today commenced a schedule of regular treatments”. “He has been advised to postpone public-facing duties”.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 02.03.24</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.03.24/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Feb 2024 20:12:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.03.24/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, US and allies launched a wave of air strikes in Yemen, hitting multiple sites controlled Houthi rebels, who are backed by Iran. The action follows US bombing in Iraq and Syria. Retaliation for the killing of three American soldiers at a remote post in Jordan last weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Department of Defense says there was rocket attacks today on a US support facility in Syria. But there were no injuries. Now, that makes a hundred and sixty-seven attacks by Iranian-backed groups on US forces in Iraq, Syria and Jordan since October. This video broadcast on Syrian TV reports to show the immediate aftermath of US strikes against Iran Revolutionary Guard and militia targets in Iraq and Syria on Friday. The Defense Department says it hit a total of seven sites including command and control centers, weapons depots and drone storage facilities. At his first public appearance since the US retaliated, President B visited his campaigned headquarters in Wilmington where he talked about the battle of White House but made no mention of the fight in the Middle East. The US action came five days after Iranian-backed groups struck a US military outpost in Jordan, injuring forty and killing army reserves soldiers W.R, B.M and K.S. But the US did not hit targets inside Iran.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 02.02.24</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.02.24/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Feb 2024 20:12:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.02.24/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We do want to begin tonight with that breaking news. The United States beginning a series of retaliatory airstrikes on site. The White House said tonight that they have clear, irrefutable evidence is connected to the deadly drone attack that killed three soldiers in Jordan. The President’s national security spokesperson J.K saying tonight the strikes were successful but that the damage assessment will be done when the sun rises in the region. And this is just the beginning. The president saying the response will continue. Here is what we know. Three of the locations hit are in Iraq. Four are in Syria and there were dozens of individual targets within each site. The strike lasted thirty minutes involving multiple aircrafts. Those planes are now out of harm’s way. And it comes on the same day President B and the First Lady J.B were at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware for the dignified transfer of the remains of those fallen service members. We just returned from the Middle East where we were the first journalist to embed with the US Navy that saw the work being done firsthand to deter Iranian-backed troops from attacking American assets in the region.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 02.01.24</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.01.24/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Feb 2024 20:12:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.01.24/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We’ll have more on the massive atmospheric river barreling through the West Coast in just a moment. But first, a Michigan mother takes the stand in the first case of a parent accused of being criminally responsible for their child’s role in a school shooting. Plus, Defense Secretary L.A apologizes to the American people for keeping his hospital stay for cancer treatment a secret, including from President B. This, as the US readies a military response for the drone attack that killed three US soldiers in Jordan. But we begin tonight with the monster Pacific storm bringing what is described as a fire hose of rain to parts of California. More than fifteen million are under flood alerts tonight. This powerful system is the first of a one-two punch. Another atmospheric river is coming in the days ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dramatic rescues today from Southern California as flood waters rushed in. A swift water rescue team saved this man trapped under a bridge in Orange County. And in Long Beach, drivers needed help getting to dry land after cars wound up submerged up to their roofs. This area just south from Los Angeles receiving nearly a month’s rain in just twelve hours. In LA, winds gusting up to forty-five miles per hour downed trees. And torrential downpours made for a dangerous morning commute. The storm slammed Northern California first, knocking down trees and flooding streets along with nearby vineyards up to three inches of rain fell.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 01.31.24</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.31.24/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Feb 2024 20:12:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.31.24/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;So much has happened since we arrived here in the Middle East on Sunday. Each day we have learned of new attacks from Iranian-back militias. American soldiers have died and American warships and aircrafts are under fire. The number of attacks from Houthi militants are increasing, and some of their weapons are getting closer. A senior defense official here in Bahrain just moments ago telling us exclusively that about 10 minutes ago, the F-18 Super Hornets bombed ten unmanned drones in Western Yemen that were preparing to launch. That is how dynamic this situation is. Also, just hours ago, there was another attack. The USS Carney shooting down a ballistic missile and several drones that were heading their way. And we’re also learning new details about that attack on a US destroyer last night. That was the USS Gravely, and the Houthi missile came within a mile of the battleship, that is significant. Because it forced sailors to use their final line of defense. Bottom line, despite the B administration’s efforts to calm tensions, things are escalating. We are the first journalist to make the long trip to Red Sea embedding with the US Navy who describes this situation as increasingly dynamic and unprecedented. We just got back after getting a close-hand look.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 01.30.24</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.30.24/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Jan 2024 20:12:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.30.24/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, we are surveying the deteriorating situation in the Middle East, from the Red Sea, to Gaza, to Iran. This is the body of three soldiers killed in Jordan prepared to make their way back to United States. First, Israeli special forces disguised as medical workers and civilians stormed hospital in the West Bank and kill three suspected militants. And negotiations continue for a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war, and the release of the remaining hostages being held by Hamas in Gaza. CBSN is over the Red Sea with the US Navy as it protects American interests in the region including from attacks by Iranian-backed Houthi militia. But President B saying he has decided on the US response to a drone attack that killed those three US service members. The president said he hold Iran responsible but warns that the world does not need a wider conflict in the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President B told reporters he has made up his mind on how to retaliate for the drone attack which killed three American soldiers in Jordan. In an apparent attempt to head off US airstrikes, Iranian-backed militia the US blames for Sunday’s deadly attack announced it was suspending military operations against American forces. The Pentagon spokesman responded by noting there have been three more attacks on US troops since the drone strike in Jordan.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 01.29.24</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.29.24/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jan 2024 20:12:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.29.24/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We are at the home of the US Fifth Fleet and Naval Forces central command getting a first look at the secret operation center here. These forces are the tip of the spear against Iranian-backed Houthi militia, defending international water against their terror attacks. And new offensive action may not be far off following that deadly attack in Jordan that killed three army soldiers and wounded more than forty others. Tonight, we are learning the extent of some of those injuries including we’ve got eight service members who had to be air-lifted and the name of three killed in the attack. Well, tonight we’ve got our new reporting that US air defensive system failed to protect that outpost. Plus, President B is vowing to retaliate, sending a clear message to Iran and others here in the region. We’ll take a look at the US options and the consequences of starting a wider conflict in the Middle East. We want to begin tonight with deadly drone attack in Jordan. CBSN has learned that the drone used in the attack appears to be an Iranian one-way attack drone like the ones Iran has been providing to Russia for its war in Ukraine. President B is vowing to strike back. But how hard and where was the topic of National Security team meeting today in the White House situation room. The drone strike on the base known as Tower 22 in northeast Jordan killed the three Americans and wounded more than forty. It was the US military’s worst loss of live to enemy action since the fall of Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 01.28.24</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.28.24/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jan 2024 20:12:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.28.24/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, President B, as you just heard, says the United States “shall respond following the deadly drone attack on American troops”. He blames Iran-backed militia for the overnight strike. It happened at a remote base in Jordan near the Iraq-Syria borders, underscoring the spreading violence in the Middle East. At least three American service members were killed. More than thirty others were wounded, some of them seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;US officials say the troops manning the outpost on the Jordanian side of the border with Syrian had little warning of the incoming drone. Many of the dead and wounded were still in their barracks when it hit. The outpost, known as Tower 22, provides support to US Special Operation Forces operating inside Syria where they are under constant threat of attack. But until now, Tower 22 had not been attacked. President B blamed it on Iranian-backed militia and vowed to retaliate. It was the US military’s worst loss of live to enemy action since the fall of Afghanistan and the first since Israel’s war with Hamas set off a drumbeat of more than one hundred-sixty attacks against US-troop locations in Iraq and Syria. Scores of troops suffered concussions in previous attacks. But there had been only one serious injury. Now the attacks have turned deadly, the B administration will be under pressure to launch much more damaging airstrikes against targets in Iraq and Syria.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 01.27.24</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.27.24/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Jan 2024 20:12:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.27.24/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, we are getting a sense of what could be the longest general election campaign in American history. President B is in South Carolina ahead of his party’s first primary of the year. The first time Democrats are beginning their primaries in the south. And Mr. B’s would be opponent is in Nevada where Republicans hold their next contest. It’s the fist time we’ve seen former President D.T since he was ordered by a New York juror to pay more than eighty-three million dollars in a federal defamation case on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;T only made a passing, very vague reference to the verdict this evening, instead of reserving most of his fire for the current occupant of the Oval Office. Appearing at a sports venue in Las Vegas today, former President T took aim at current President B. Meanwhile, President B took off for South Carolina where he visited a local barbershop and hold a rally in the state of the first 2024 Democratic primary. But it’s the state of the US border dominating the news cycle. Lawmakers in the Senate are on the verge of a bipartisan compromise on immigration reform. But the former president has stepped in to try to stop it. But some Republicans are pushing back saying they’re unlikely to get a better offer. In a statement lately, President B said if pass, it would be the toughest and fairest border in history, giving him the power to shut down the border as soon as he signs it. The question now is will it make it to the president’s desk or become a casualty of the campaign.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 01.26.24</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.26.24/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Jan 2024 20:12:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.26.24/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, the big news from border where migrants crossing hit a new record in December. Hundreds of thousands of them encountered by border agents. Plus, Boeing 737 Max 9 is returning to the skies. But want to begin tonight with D.T. The jury found him acted “maliciously, out of hatred, ill will or spite” in his ongoing verbal attacks on the former Elle magazine columnist. They concluded he should pay 83.3 million in damages. A previous jury found T liable for sexually abusing and defaming C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E.J.C was all smiles as she left the courthouse following the jury’s unanimous verdict ordering former President D.T to pay her more than 83 million dollars for defamatory statement he made about her in 2019. The dollar amount including 7.3 million dollars for emotional harm, 11 million to help repair her reputation and 65 million dollars in punitive damages. C’s attorney had previously told the jury “The one thing D.T cares about is money”. They deliberated for fewer than three hours. T wasn’t in the courtroom for the verdict but immediately took his social media to call the ruling “absolutely ridiculous” saying he fully disagrees. T was in court earlier in the day. There was a dramatic moment when abruptly got up and left as C’s lead attorney made her closing arguments, a break of decorum in federal court. T returned in time for closing arguments from his attorney Ms. H who was herself reprimanded by the judge multiple times. When she played a video of T responding to the prior jury verdict, finding him liable of sexual abuse and defamation the judge to told the jury to disregard it since he had repeatedly warned the defense team to not retry that case. When she protested not being allowed to discuss tweets not in evidence, Judge K says “You are on the verge of spending some time in the lock up, now sit down”.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 01.25.24</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.25.24/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jan 2024 20:12:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.25.24/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;You just heard from Republican Senators M.R and L.G just when Congress appears to close to a deal on southern border and funding for Ukraine, there are concerns election politics are getting in the way. The election’s other top issue, the economy. We’ve got big news today. US GOP grew at surprising pace last quarter. But despite low unemployment and a booming stock market, we speak to Americans about why some are not feeling the effects. But, we begin tonight with severe weather, nearly twenty-six million people are under flood-water watches from Louisianna to West Virginia with more rain expected in the days ahead. Parts of the South are already underwater tonight after days of torrential rains, with more than a foot on the ground in parts of Texas and several inches in Louisianna.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A city submerged. Cars plowing through floodwater in Mandeville, Louisianna, north of New Orleans. This is what six-inches of rain in less than twenty-four hours looks like. A first-responder helping a passenger to safety. In Texas, the storm is over, but the emergency is ongoing. Emergency crews use these boats to rescue from more than a dozen homes including a few pets. First responders say one home owner wouldn’t leave until it is almost too late. Five people have to be rescued after trying to drive through the fast-flowing water.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 01.24.24</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.24.24/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Jan 2024 20:12:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.24.24/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;You just heard from Boeing’s CEO as America’s largest airplane manufacturer is under increased scrutiny. The FAA is now investigating a new incident after the front nose wheel of a Delta plane fell off over a weekend. We are also watching dangerous weather across the country. A state of emergency out West. The video of a dramatic water rescue of a woman who was stranded for fourteen hours. Well, that same storm system in the South now, thirty-six million people are under flood water across seven states. Why scientists are warning weather like this is becoming more common. But we begin with D.T’s double-digit win over N.H in New Hampshire. The big question tonight, what does that mean for the future of the former governor’s campaign? Take a look at this map. The former president’s back-to-back wins make the road forward complicated for H. And she is in South Carolina tonight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N.H insists she is still in the hunt for the Republican presidential nomination today after losing the New Hampshire primary. H’s persistence appears to frustrate D.T. South Carolina Senator L.G is one of more than one hundred and sixty of Congress backing T, a sign the GOP is rallying around his campaign. President B is already in general election mode saying it is now clear that D.T will be the Republican nominee and the stakes could not be higher. B used his endorsement today by the United Auto Workers to highlight the differences with T.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 01.23.24</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.23.24/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jan 2024 20:12:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.23.24/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We are live from here in Manchester as voters cast their ballots in this first-in-the-nation primary. CBSN can project at this hour that D.T is the winner of New Hampshire’s Republican presidential primary. These are the vote tallies, just coming in right now at this hour. We should note, no Republican has ever won both Iowa and New Hampshire and failed to secure the nomination. But tonight, N.H said this race is far from over. We are hearing from both of the candidates tonight and they are beginning to set expectations about the campaign ahead. We also had exit-poll data. But the shape of what this electorate was like here in New Hampshire. It was more moderate, more independent than what we saw in Iowa. Also, the economy, and immigration some of the top issues on voters’ minds. And one in five voters made their decisions in the last couple days and they largely broke for N.H.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we are live in the West here on the Evening News, former President T is addressing his supporters, declaring victory here in New Hampshire and already going after N.H for staying in this race saying he’s angry she’s doing so and suggesting she only won because she won non-Republican votes. He has a point. Exit-poll here in New Hampshire shows this was a far more moderate and independent base of voters much more so than were in Iowa last week. H doing well with them. More independent voters voted tonight in New Hampshire than Republicans and broke overwhelmingly for H. A few warning signs, however, for the former President as he continues his campaign. Polling tonight shows there’s more skepticism and concern about the legal troubles he may face in the coming months and a belief that he may not be fit enough for office should he be convicted of a crime. That’s a higher percentage than we saw in Iowa last week and concerning in a state that very well could be one of the battlegrounds in the general election in the fall. And well, the former president won most age and gender groups across Republican electorate. H did better tonight among higher-incoming college-educated voters, a sign, again, that the former president may struggle to unite the entire Republican party and other voters who he might have well been able to win another one.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 01.22.24</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.22.24/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jan 2024 20:12:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.22.24/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;N.H is campaigning across New Hampshire like her political life depends on it. With Florida D.S now out of the race throwing his support behind D.T, H is scrambling to make up her double-digit deficit in the polls. At every stop today, H hoped to sway an undecided voter and for one independent we spoked with, it worked. New Hampshire GOP Chairman C.A says independent voters don’t think alike. T is campaigning here after a detour to New York, where the E.J.C defamation trail was delayed when a juror fell sick and he is increasingly confident the nomination could be wrapped up by tomorrow. And then in New Hampshire the secretary of state is projecting record turnout in the Republican presidential primary expecting thirty-seven thousand more voters than in the last competitive GOP race in 2016. And rallies like behind me are aimed at turning every last vote. The Democratic National Committee had changed their primary calendar to prioritize South Carolina so B will not be on the ballot here in New Hampshire in the primary. So, Democrats are urging a write-in campaign.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 01.20.24</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.20.24/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Jan 2024 20:12:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.20.24/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, millions of Americans from Montana to New Hampshire are enduring some of the coldest temperatures so far this winter. For many, a thaw is insight, the latest extreme weather in just a moment. But we begin tonight with the countdown of Tuesday’s first in the nation primary. Former South Carolina Governor N.H defending off attacks from her two main rivals as they worked to drive her from the race. Today, she questioned the mental fitness of front runner D.T.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the temperature outside has dropped, but inside the heat is on between N.H and D.T as the former president looked to New Hampshire to solidify his path to the nomination. Competing in New Hampshire, D.T and N.H are questioning each other’s fitness for office. At the rally here, T confused H with N.P blaming her for security failures on January 6th. But T maintained the commanding lead in the polls here and he is rolling out key endorsements from H’s home state. With T.S, whom H. had appointed to the US Senate, T has support over half the Republicans in Congress that includes New York Congresswoman H.S. At T’s headquarter in Manchester, volunteers like R. are working the phones.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 01.19.24</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.19.24/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Jan 2024 20:12:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.19.24/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We’ll have more on the deadly storm slamming much of the country with snow and artic cold in a moment. But first, the stunning new indictment of A.B. Why prosecutors once again charge the actor with involuntary man slaughter in connection with 2021 shooting death on the set of movie Rust. What led them to bring back the criminal case nine months after initial charges were dropped. Plus, CBSN joined the Navy in the Middle East. But we want to begin with the second major winter storm in less than a week dropping heavy snow from Washington to Philadelphia to New York.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an unexpected site for drivers on snowy road in Virginia today. This commuter airplane carrying five passengers and two crew members in an emergency landing four minutes after taking off from nearby Dallas Airport. The plane made it up about eleven hundred feet before having to divert and make an emergency landing on the L county parkway. A ground stop in Washington Reagan frost travel planes earlier this morning with over thousand cancellations nationwide. New York’s LaGuardia and New Jersey’s Newark among the hardest hit. Wintry conditions are pummeling roads. In New York, a car trying to pass a semi crashed into a snowplow, no one was injured. In Nutley, New Jersey, the Department of Transportation is trying to drive home road safety.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 01.18.24</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.18.24/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jan 2024 20:12:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.18.24/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;In a devastating new report, the Department of Justice blames cascading failures of leadership, decision-making, tactics, policy and training for why police waited seventy-seven minutes before confronting the gunman at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde. Associate Attorney General V.G led the investigation. After reviewing over fourteen thousand pieces of data, more than two hundred and sixty interviews, the report lays much of the blame on then-school Police Chief P.A and his failure to treat it as an active shooter situation and not send all available resources toward the threat until entry was made into the classrooms. A. instead chose to evacuate other classrooms and wait for keys, backup and tools. A student from inside the classroom called 911 asking for help. An officer still waited nearly forty minutes before stopping the shooter. Only a handful of officers at the scene have lost their job or resigned. Since the Uvalde school shooting, districts across the country have reassessed their security protocols.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 01.17.24</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.17.24/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Jan 2024 20:12:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.17.24/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;First, the health scares facing the royal family. We learned today that the Princess of Wales, K.M, who’s forty-two years old will be in the hospital for two weeks following abdominal surgery. And just hour later, King C announced he, too, would be hospitalized for treatment for an enlarged prostate. But we do want to begin with that really awful weather that has killed dozens of people including two adults and a teenager just today in Portland. When a live power line fell on their car, a baby was injured but did survive. Winter storm warnings are in effect in nine states from Washington to South Dakota. A hundred and thirty-two million Americans in forty-four states will have temperatures in the teens or below tonight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight, the deadly cold snap continues to grip the nation with dozens of weather-related deaths so far, many caused by hypothermia and crashes on the road. Among the victims, five family members in northeastern Pennsylvania all killed after being struck by a tractor trailer. So far, at least ten died in Oregon after a string of storms plunged parts of the state into a deep freeze. Up to a quarter inch of ice made driving treacherous around Portland. Heavy ice and strong winds toppled more than three hundred trees in the area. The winter blast knocked out nearly seventy-six thousand Oregon customers. A third of the flights out of Portland were canceled today. In Buffalo, New York, plows are battling lake-effect snow-fall up to four inches an hour, more than two feet could blanket the region by Thursday. Snow also fell further south in Knoxville, Tennessee, where it caused this boat dock to collapse. And in several cities including Bellingham, Washington, schools were closed. Residents urged to stay close to home and stay safe.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 01.16.24</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.16.24/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Jan 2024 20:12:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.16.24/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, D.T fresh off his record setting win in the Iowa caucuses is now in New Hampshire after a trip to New York City and a courthouse there. These are pictures of his rally tonight where he will address voters in the Granite State. And we are in New Hampshire tonight speaking with voters ahead of the next contest in the race for the Republican nomination. Also tonight, we are hearing for the first time, the 911 calls that led to two-week hospital stay for the Secretary of Defense L.A. Hear his aide asking for secrecy. But we want to begin with the weather that most of us are experiencing more than seventy percent of the country is feeling a deep freeze. Seventeen people have died and there is another storm coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight, the Arctic blast along with high winds and blinding snow swept through the Northeast, the extreme cold and snow forcing airlines to cancel or delay flights. At New York’s LaGuardia airport, more than two hundred cancellations since yesterday. In Nashville, a ground stop on Monday left hundreds of passengers stuck on the tarmac, some for almost seven hours after deicing trucks ran out of fuel. It’s a mess throughout the Midwest. At Chicago’s O’Hare Airport, negative twenty-degree windchills are hampering operations.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 01.15.24</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.15.24/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jan 2024 20:12:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.15.24/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We want to begin tonight with the Iowa caucuses, the first contest of the 2024 election. And we have breaking news, CBSN can project former President D.T will win the Republican caucuses. Our data desk is able to make this call because of entrance polls and other data. The GOP front runner has led every poll in the Hawkeye State ahead of tonight’s victory in his bid for the Republican nomination. And we’re also getting a picture of what is on voter’s minds because of these entrance polls. They reveal the economy and immigration are the top concerns for Republicans in Iowa. One of the big stories tonight is going to be the battle for second place. N.H and R.D are hoping to come close to T while looking ahead to next week’s N.H primary. This is expected to be the coldest causes day ever. Turnout, a big question with those subzero temperatures and voters facing dangerous conditions just to support their candidate of choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the bitter cold, despite his mounting legal challenges, former President T has been able to keep together his conservative coalition in this conservative state. And he was battling rivals who have been largely competing for second place like Florida Governor R.D, who has staked much of his campaign on Iowa. Trying to knock on nearly a million doors through his super PAC, and getting support of the Iowa Governor. But not enough to beat T. Meanwhile, former T ambassador N.H who has real momentum in New Hampshire coming up on the primary calendar. She has spent a lot of time in Iowa as well, hoping to get a bounce here in to that Granite State primary. Many time GOP donors tell me they are watching her finish tonight very closely and ready to pour millions behind her candidacy. Make her the standard bearer for the non-T wing of the party. But T plows ahead in this race as the early beginning of the race. But his legal challenges will continue. Sources tell CBSN he is scheduled to appear tomorrow at the E.J.C defamation case in New York all while the January 6th case looms in Washinton and that classified documents case as well among myriad other legal challenges.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 01.14.24</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.14.24/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jan 2024 20:12:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.14.24/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Nearly one hundred million of you are under wind chill warnings or advisories as an Arctic blast grips the wide swath of this country. The National Weather Service warns the extreme temperatures pose a risk of frostbite and hypothermia. This is Buffalo, New York where a blizzard is blasting the city with snow and howling winds. The snow is also piling up in Utah as the avalanche threat increases. This video was captured in Cottonwood Canyon near Salt Lake City. The state’s avalanche center is warning of “extreme extraordinarily dangerous avalanche condition”. And look at these temperatures, brutal, from the Pacific Northwest to the Northeast, the extreme cold also putting electrical grids to the test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, it is a whiteout here in the Southtowns, not far from Buffalo. Snowfall rates of three to four inches an hour. Just about everything in and out Buffalo International Airport today was canceled. Americans are feeling the dangerous deep freeze. Blizzard conditions in the Buffalo area can dump as much as three feet of snow by Monday. Wind gusts there were clocked at over sixty miles per hour. The NFL pushed today’s Steelers-Bills game till to Monday after whiteout conditions made travel to the stadium possible. The dangerous weather stretched West to California and South to Texas. At least three people are dead near Portland, Oregon from falling trees and bitter cold. Along the east coast, Maine is seeing historic flooding. Four people were rescued from the fishing boat after waves slammed it into the shore. And in Iowa, wind chills have dipped to forty-five below zero as voters gear up for caucus day tomorrow. Back in Buffalo, travel is stalled as airlines ground flights and officials urge drivers to stay off the roads.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 01.13.24</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.13.24/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Jan 2024 20:12:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.13.24/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, more than thirty million people are under winter weather advisories with freezing temperatures expanding across the country this weekend. It is snowing and so cold in Buffalo, tomorrow’s Bills-Steelers playoff game has been postponed until Monday. And tonight’s Chief-Dolphin’s game in Kansas City could be one of the coldest games on record. Just take a look at these feel-like temperatures, Glasgow, Montana, negative forty-four. Dickinson, North Dakota bottoms out at fifty-one below, Hasting, Nebraska, minus thirty-two. Extreme weather across the Plains made for crippling driving conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s this drifting snow that is creating a lot of the issues on the roads. We’ve seen a number of jackknifed semis and now this bitter cold really is setting in. Here in Iowa, in what has known as the world’s largest truck stop, it is packed with drivers and truckers who simply aren’t taking any chances on the icy roads. Dangerous whiteout conditions in Iowa and other Midwestern states making travel treacherous. The heavy snow and gusty winds are causing big rigs, like these, to crash. Iowans are digging out after almost fifteen inches of snow blanketed the state. And temperatures are plummeting across, with the wind chill as low as negative sixty-five degrees in the Great Plains. This woeful weather also having a national impact on travel with more than two thousand flights canceled today. In Maine, record-breaking water levels not seen there in almost fifty years – washing away this Portland fish shacks. And avalanche is in effect for six mountain ranges in Utah, where officials say today conducted mitigation operation. This on the heel of 2023 being named the warmest year on record.

What the wild weather means for the NFL playoffs? Also, there is bitter cold and whiteout conditions in Iowa just as the 2024 election is heating up. It’s the final countdown for the kickoff of the race for the White House.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But first, we’ve got more on that military bombardment of terrorist targets in Yemen from US and British fighter jets, ships and submarine. We are just learning new details as President B today issued a fresh warning to the Houthi militia that the US will fight back if the rebel retaliate. The President tonight clearly trying to contain what is now an escalating regional conflict. It is exactly what many had feared as the worst outcome as we are now nearly one hundred days since Hamas attacked Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repeated ultimatums gave way to military action overnight as F-18 fighter jets and support aircraft led the way in a bombing campaign against Iranian-backed Houthi militants including the use of US warships and a submarine. British typhoon fighters took off from bases in Cyprus covering a distance so long, they needed refueling aircraft. Cockpit footage is said to show airstrikes aimed at degrading Houthi capabilities and weapon stocks. US military officials say more than a hundred and fifty precision-guided munitions struck over sixty targets at nearly thirty locations including command centers, missile and drone launch sites and air defense systems. Today, in Yemen, thousands of demonstrators turned out in the capital, burning US flags and chanting “God is great, death to America, death to Israel”.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 01.11.24</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.11.24/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jan 2024 20:12:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.11.24/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, we are just four days away from the Iowa caucuses and there are major stories that are top concern to the American people and will impact the race for the White House, starting with the most important issue to voters – the economy. And we learned today the inflation was up last month more than expected. The new data out today shows one of the biggest reasons is housing costs. Plus, the immigration crisis remains the top of mind for voters as they made their voices heard in the 2024 election cycle. Tonight, we have an in-depth look at the strain in the classroom as tens of thousands of migrants crossed the border and their children entered public schools. And then the other big headline today, former President D.T was not on campaign trail, but inside a courtroom. Tonight, his outburst at the prosecutor and the judge and what the outcome at that three hundred and seventy million dollars civil fraud trail could mean for his real estate empire. Let’s begin with the economy, inflation jumped unexpectedly today, ticking up slightly to an annual rate of 3.4%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Las Vegas mortgage broker J.W says the economy is not working for her or her customers hunting for home loans. W, a Republican, says the stubbornly high cost of living means her company processes fewer mortgage applications. While inflation is off the highs of 2022, monthly budget items have continued to soar. Rent was up 6.2% last year. Auto insurance skyrocketed 20%. And dinning out jumped 5.2%. L.B is Director of the National Economic Council. She is the president’s top advisor on the economy.

Former New Jersey C.C just suspending his presidential campaign just five days before Iowa caucuses. Our new reporting tonight who he might endorse and if it will change the Republican battle. Plus, those winter storms slammed the Northeast, with flooding in New Hampshire, Connecticut, and New Jersey. And authorities in Florida are now assessing those tornado damages. But first, there is more breaking news tonight with a major avalanche closing down a popular Lake Tahoe ski resort in California. Search teams and emergency crews just finished scouring the slopes in search of any missing skiers or snowboarders. We know that at least one person has died and at least three people are hurt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peril at Palisades. First responders scrambled to search victims buried in the snow after an avalanche struck a ski resort near Lake Tahoe in Sierra Nevada. It happened around 9:30 AM local time at Palisades Tahoe just as an early group of skiers started to head down the mountain.

The dangerous weather from not one but two major winter storms. The National Service today, saying forty-seven states are under weather alerts. We’re talking about deadly tornadoes in the south, blizzard conditions in the Midwest and here in the mid-Atlantic and Northeast, high-winds and heavy rain and floodings. Nearly two hundred and ten million American are in the path of this monster storm and parts of the northeast are under state of emergency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parts of the Florida pan handle pummeled by a powerful tornado blasting through block after block, blowing apart buildings, shredding structures, and lifting homes off their foundation. Then the winds whipped north. Tonight, eighty-four million people are under flood watches and warnings along the east coast. In Baltimore, sandbags are helping protect low lying areas. And the Governor of New Jersey has declared a state of emergency.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 01.08.24</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.08.24/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jan 2024 20:12:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.08.24/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We want to begin tonight with a major development after that terrifying incident in the sky. We learned just a short time ago about troubling new safety concerns and installation issues on Boeing’s 737 Max 9s. Those could be related to what caused the in-flight blowout on board an Alaska Airlines plane. Remember, the cabin lost pressure, horrifying passengers as items, including an iPhone that remain intact, was actually sucked out of the plane. The data from the cockpit voice recorder was erased, making the investigation more difficult. Well, today, the head of the NTSB said had that plane been flying any higher, it could have been catastrophic for the 171 passengers on board. As a result, every Boeing 737 Max 9 was grounded. That’s more than a hundred and seventy planes. And for days now, these inspections have been ongoing. So late today, United had revealing they have found what some of these issues are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investigation here remains centered on the 737 Max 9 behind us here, but the concern about the air plane is growing after United Airlines began inspecting its Max 9s and on a handful of planes found loose bolts, bolts that hold that piece of the plane in place. Sources tell us, it’s at least five airplanes, but those inspections are ongoing. United believed those loose bolts stem from the manufacturing process.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 01.06.24</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.06.24/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Jan 2024 20:12:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.06.24/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, the northeast is in the midst of the first big snowstorm of the season. A wintry mix is hitting the region, bringing snow, rain and icy roads. Up to a foot of snow is expected along a huge stretch of the East, from Pennsylvania to Maine. But first, we begin with the investigation into an Alaska Airlines jet had a section of its fuselage blow out mid-air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the FAA is temporarily grounding and requiring immediate inspections of about 171 Boeing 737 Max 9 airplanes after that flight’s plane lost a chunk of its shell in mid-air, forcing an emergency landing in Portland. Horror in the air as a plug door blew off this plane while it was 16000 feet in the sky. The 171 passengers and six crew members on board the aircraft Friday evening were headed to Ontario, California. Videos taken from inside the plane show passengers appearing calm. The plane had only been in service for a couple of months. Tonight, the FAA is ordering inspections of that airliner and dozens more like it. Alaska and United Airlines are the only US carriers that use 737 Max 9. Both airlines are warning passengers to expect delays as the planes go inspections.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 01.04.24</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.04.24/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Jan 2024 20:12:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.04.24/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We want to begin tonight with the scary reality facing parents and students and the continuing cycle of gun violence in the America’s schools and the alarming new details in today’s school shooting in Iowa. Police saying just a short time ago, that an explosive device was found inside the school. Here is what we know. A six-grade student was killed. The school’s principal and four others were injured. The seventeen-year-old shooter dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Now, this is the second school shooting of 2024 just four days now into the new year. And there are questions tonight about the gunman’s social media posts and his motive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shooting happened during a breakfast program about 20 minutes before school was set to begin. And there weren’t yet that many people around. So tonight, police say it could have been much worse. It was the first day back to school in Perry, Iowa after the winter holiday when at 7:37 AM shots rang out. Within seven minutes, the first officer arrived, followed by more than one hundred others from local, state, and federal agencies. “Officers immediately attempted the source of the threat and quickly found what appeared to be the shooter with a self-inflicted gunshot wound”. The shooter, identified as seventeen-year-old D.B, a student at the school. He shot and killed a six-grade and wounded five others, including the school’s principal, D.M. All the victims were rushed to nearby hospital in Des Moines. Officials say the shooter used a pump action shotgun and a handgun. They also located and disarmed an improvised explosive device inside the school. In the last five years, one hundred and sixty-one people have been killed in school shootings, with more than three hundred injured.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 01.03.24</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.03.24/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Jan 2024 20:12:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.03.24/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We want to begin tonight with the southern border, where no matter what party you’re in, there’s an agreement that something must be done to stop the unprecedented number of migrants coming across the border. But once again, while there is agreement on that, for decades, both Republicans and Democrats have been unable to pass comprehensive immigration reform. As it stands now, President B has proposed fourteen billion dollars in new funding to hire new border agents, asylum officers and immigration judges as well as new technologies to combat the flow of fentanyl. But tonight, you’ll hear from the new Republican Speaker of the House in an interview with CBSN. A record-breaking number of migrants are crossing into the United States an average about two hundred and fifty thousand per month since August. And in December, the numbers hit an all-time high with more than three hundred thousand. Well, today, a delegation of House Republicans is in the region to draw attention to the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;House Speaker J and the Republican delegation got a briefing and a firsthand look at the operations during the southern border crisis, something that local officials say has been burdening border towns. Even as House Speaker J and a group of more than sixty fellow Republicans getting briefed near the US-Mexico border migrants waded across the Rio Grande. Thousands of migrants have across illegally in the Del Rio sector, which includes town of Eagle Pass, where Fire Chief M.M says the numbers are overwhelming. Most migrants entered the US illegally but claimed asylum which means they can’t be immediately deported. To share the burden, Texas Republican Governor G.A has bused thousands of migrants to cities led by Democrats, including New York, Chicago, and Denver, where today, an encampment was taken down with hundreds of migrants moved into shelters already approaching capacity. And the buses keep showing up. Just outside Chicago, and just outside New York City, they’re targeting the suburbs to get around new local laws to require advanced notice.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 01.02.24</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.02.24/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Jan 2024 20:12:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.02.24/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin with a shakeup at the top of one of the nation’s most prominent universities. The president of Harvard, C.G, resigned today following accusations of plagiarism and alleged mismanagement of antisemitism on campus since the start of the war between Israel and Hamas. The announcement comes less than a month that after her congressional testimony that sparked outrage and intense backlash both on critics and prominent university donors. G becomes the second Ivy League leader to step down following last month’s contentious hearing before the House committee on education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pressure had been building on C.G to step down even she apologized for her testimony last month. It wasn’t enough making her the shortest serving president in history of the university. Six months into her tenure as Harvard University President C.G announced she is resigning “so that our community can navigate this moment of extraordinary challenge”. G’s resignation comes nearly a month that after she and the president of UPenn and MIT faced widespread condemnation following this testimony at a House education hearing on antisemitism on college campuses. While Harvard’s governing board initially backed G she faced increasing scrutiny on charges of plagiarism in her dissertation and several articles, including reports of a new complaint filed this week. G, who was Harvard’s first Black female president denied the allegation of plagiarism and stated “it has been distressing to have doubt cast on my commitments to confronting hate and to upholding scholarly rigor and frightening to be subjected to personal attacks and threats fueled by racial animus”.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 01.01.24</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.01.24/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jan 2024 20:12:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.01.24/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Now to rising tensions in the Middle East. President B was briefed by his national security teams this morning about the escalating conflict between Iranian backed rivals and the United States Navy. Meanwhile, Israel announced it’s withdrawing thousands of troops from Gaza signaling a new phase in the fighting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sirens rang in the new year in Israel as Hamas fired rockets. The country’s Iron Dome missile defense system illuminated the sky with interceptions. But in Gaza, 2024 looks a lot like the previous year. Men rescued an injured child as a sound of explosions chased them in Khan Younis. But hospitals in Gaza are so full. Doctors treat injured children on the floor. In Rafa, at this cramped tent city, everyone hopes the new year will bring peace. Israel has also experienced loss in this war. The IDF says more than a hundred seventy soldiers have been killed since the ground invasion in Gaza. On Sunday, Israel began demobilizing thousands of troops, the first drawdown since the war began with Hamas’s murderous attack in October. It comes amid mounting pressure from the White House to scale back the offensive but Israeli officials warned the end of this war is still months away. Over the weekend, militants attacked from Syria and Lebanon. Israel retaliated, striking Hezbollah targets. The treats to Israeli as well as US interests also extend to the Red Sea. Iran sailed a warship into the water today, a day after the US Navy engaged four Houthi boats from Yemen that attacked a commercial ship, sinking three.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 12.31.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.31.23/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2024 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.31.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight is the final hours of this year ??? revelers around the world rising a toast to 2024 many hoping for better times. And it is already different 2024 after all is a leap here three hundred sixty-six days. Clocks in Europe’s capitols latest strike midnight from Berlin to Paris and finally London. In New York, the ball is yet to drop at the big crowds there in the nation’s largest police forces about to keep everybody safe and secure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials say there are no credible threats but NYPD and federal law enforcement taking extra precautions as the festivities get underway. High above the celebration, law enforcement is on high alert. This year, officers on the lookout for protests like those that interrupted the Thanksgiving Day parade, and the tree lightning in November. And Police used drones for the first time ever to monitor potential dangers. Below Times Square, the busiest mass transit ??? the city will be watched closely. This historic celebration named for the New York Times, it’s all the way back to 1904. In Chicago, the sky’s over late Michigan will be lit up more than one hundred thousand fireworks and Las Vegas will close the strip for more than four hundred thousand people are expected. Back in New York, revelers are filling Times Square and focusing on the future. NYPD’s safety measures go far beyond Times Square. Police say they do expect two million people to come to New York to watch the ball drop but they will be spread out throughout the five ???&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 12.30.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.30.23/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Dec 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.30.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, there are several developing stories as we come on the air. Here in the New York, revelers are getting ready to usher in the new year under the bright lights of Times Square. Today, there was one last test of the crystal ball drop. The giant numbers, 2024, also in place, and law enforcement on high alert. In the West, dangerous monster waves are slamming southern California and prompting new safety warnings. We’ll have the latest in a moment. But we begin the war in Gaza. Today, Israeli forces pushed deeper in the besieged territory, striking areas filled with displaced civilians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A defiant Israeli prime minister warned the war could last for many more months until all objectives are archived. Misery in Gaza starts here. Airstrikes pounding the coastal territory. Israel says it is targeting Hamas militants. But many times, it is civilians caught in the explosions. Rescuers desperately work to pull this injured boy from the rubble. Morgues become production lines of volunteers wrapping the dead. The white shroud in ever-present symbol of heartbreak and loss. Those who survive a strike, or flee ahead of one, end up here, massive tent communities crowding the southern city of Rafa. CBSN found hundreds standing in the food line Friday, a handout away from starvation.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 12.29.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.29.23/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Dec 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.29.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We are following several developing stories as 2023 comes to an end and a new year about to begin. That includes security concerns as millions gathered for New Year’s Eve celebrations. Preparations are underway in some of the nation’s biggest cities with the FBI warning of an increased risks of attacks. Tonight, we speak with NYPD about keeping a ball drop safe. And a New Year means new loss for half the county that means minimum wage is going up. We’ll take a look at how the increase impacts workers and businesses. But we begin with the weather and millions of Americans bracing for rain, wind and possible flooding. There is also risk of more massive waves like the one that slammed the California coast. Some as high as twenty-five feet, damaging homes and prompting evacuations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Communities all up and down, the California coast hit hard by this powerful storm. Arguably, some of the worst damage here in the coast community Aptos, they really got hit hard. A lot of people who have lived here in this northern California community really said it was kind of insult injury. They were already putting their homes and businesses back together from the last round of powerful storms. Massive waves crashing a shore in southern California sent people running Thursday. Ocean water surged into streets and flooded local businesses. This video shows the moment of wave breached sea walls sweeping away nearly twenty by standers and injuring eight who were taken to the hospital Thursday. Powerful winter storms in the Pacific Ocean whipped up the dangerous surf along the entire west coast putting nearly five million residents under high surf of warning. In northern California, some seaside businesses were forced to close and residents are now having to cleanup.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 12.28.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.28.23/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Dec 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.28.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight on the campaign trail for the 2024 Republican Nomination. N.H is facing a barrage of criticism, not for something she said during the New Hampshire town hall but for something she didn’t say when a voter asked simply what caused the civil war. The former South Carolina Governor and T administration UN ambassador did not mention slavery in her answer. Instead, she said it was about the role of government and the rights of the people. H attempted to clean up her remarks today and blamed the Democratic plan for the question. And this breaking news, D.T has been removed from another state’s primary ballot, this time in Maine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying to spring an upset, N.H has been fighting for months to win the spotlight. But tonight, she is beneath a glaring one and taking the heat. N.H who has been surging in the poll in New Hampshire, now faces a rising wave of criticism over this response to a question that at a town hall event. She called the question a plant of the Democrats.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 12.27.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.27.23/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Dec 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.27.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with the crisis in the southern border. Right now, a massive convoy of migrants is making its way through Mexico and towards the United States. Secretary of State A.B and the Homeland Security Secretary A.M traveled to Mexico’s City today. They met with Mexico president to discuss ways to stem the flow of migrants coming into this country. Mexico’s president says he is willing to help but wants the US to address the main cause of the problem by improving relations with Venezuela and Cuba. He also wants more money for development in the region. Border security agents, aid groups, and local communities are stretched thin amid a record number of asylum seekers approaching the US-Mexico border every day. Thousands of migrants, most from central and south America are part of the latest caravan moving through southern Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking to start a new year in a new country, as many as ten thousand migrants each day are crossing southern border into the United States. Meanwhile, about one thousand men, women and children from multiple Latin American countries are making their way north through Mexico, the largest such caravan in months. The influx is having an impact as far north as New York, where the city says taking care of asylum seekers will cost an estimated $12 billion over the next three years. This chartered plane carrying hundreds of migrants from El Paso to Queens was forced to land in Philadelphia Tuesday night, due to bad weather. The passenger instead boarded buses bound for Manhattan arranged by Texas Governor G.A.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 12.26.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.26.23/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Dec 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.26.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with seven million Americans under threat of a massive winter storm sweeping across the central US. Blizzard warnings and winter weather alerts are up across nine states from Colorado to Minnesota with snow, ice and high winds creating whiteout conditions. Several interstates face partial closures and slick roads resulted in dozens of crashes and at least one death. Elsewhere, millions of drivers are heading home from their Christmas vacation, while air travelers were hit with long delays in airports. On East Coast, big fog caused delays and flight diversions, including at Boston Logan Airport, in the post-holiday travel rush.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the TSA, over twelve million passengers have crossed through security checkpoints from Thursday to Monday. And here at LaGuardia Airport things have gone pretty smoothly, but that hasn’t been the case for everyone across the country. Tonight, millions of Americans are packing airports and braving bad weather to get home after the holiday. Five states are under blizzard warning including Colorado until Wednesday. More than five hundred flights were delayed there today. Nearly two hundred cancelations lit up the departure board at Chicago’s Midway International Airport over the holiday, leaving travelers searching for a way out. Drivers also facing dangerous conditions and in Upstate New York overnight, seven people were sent to the hospital when fog led to this crash.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 12.25.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.25.23/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Dec 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.25.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin this Christmas nights overseas in Gaza with some of the most intense fighting since the start of the war. Israel launched airstrikes on about two hundred targets, in the last twenty-four hours, including a refugee camp. That strike killed more than one hundred civilians. Anger and frustration over hostages held by Hamas is growing. Family members heckled Israeli Prime Minister B.N today during a speech to parliament. The message? Bring their loved ones home. And now, fears the war will escalate beyond Gaza after a suspected Israeli airstrike on the Syrian capital of Damascus killed a senior leader of Iran Revolutionary Guard. Iran is vowing revenge. Elsewhere, Pope F used his Christmas message to ask the world to pray for peace as he called for a ceasefire and the release of all hostages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Egyptian proposal includes a ceasefire, a phased release of hostages, and the creation of a Palestinian government of experts who would lead the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. But amid reports Hamas has already rejected the deal, Israel airstrikes on Gaza are only intensifying. Christmas was a day of carnage in Gaza. After Israeli military carried out dozens of airstrikes on the Maghazi refugee camp killing at least a hundred Palestinians according to the Hamas-run ministry of health. In what is being described the deadliest attack since the fighting began, on the ground, the grief was unbearable. Israeli military said it was reviewing the incident after announcing seventeen of its soldiers had been killed over the weekend, its worst two-day losses since early November. Prime Minister B.N met with soldiers in Northern Gaza where he told them “We will not stop forget anyone who talks about stopping”. Elsewhere, in the West Bank city of Bethlehem, in the shadow of the Church of the Nativity, a soul incubator. Inside, a figure representing baby Jesus as a symbol of Gaza’s vulnerable babies. A grim theme also on display in nearby Manger Square where a stark nativity scene of Christ born amid rubble and barbed wire was set up. This Christmas, the holy city of Bethlehem was in no mood to celebrate. Back in Gaza, the small Christian community, one of the world’s oldest continue to struggle to survive, but danger is everywhere around them.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 12.22.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.22.23/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Dec 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.22.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin with that powerful storm system bringing heavy rain from southern California into the desert southwest. It’s complicating the holiday rush on one of the busiest travel days of the year. Twenty-six million people were under flood watch today, with some areas already hit with a month’s worth of rain in twenty-four hours or less. The storm is blamed for at least one death tonight. Torrential rain unleashed a messy mudslide in the Hollywood Hills, and the mountains of Southern California could end up with more than a foot and a half of rain by the time the storm winds down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This history-making storm left behind quite a mess and it did so with ferocious intensity. This is what happens when so much rain falls so fast. Cars one after another hydroplaning out of control on a major freeway. Farther south, a truck skidded off road plunging into a storm channel. In Santa Bara, the streets became rivers, roads became impassable although one stuck driver managed to push his way out. Since Sunday, the city of Santa Barbara has received nearly seven inches of rainfall, Oxnard just over six but that city got a month’s worth of rain in just sixty minutes deluge.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 12.21.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.21.23/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Dec 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.21.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;An intense storm is slamming the west, impacting holiday travel and we’ll get to it in a moment. But we begin in central Europe with a rare deadly mass shooting on a university campus. At least fourteen people were killed and twenty-five other wounded when a lone gunman opened fire from the roof of a building at Charles University in Prague, the Capital City of the Czech Republic. Police say they later found the body of the gunman, a twenty-four-year-old student at that school. And this happened in the heart of historic Prague. Police say there is no indication of any political or terrorism motive for today’s attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shots fired, and chaos erupted mid-afternoon at Charles University in central Prague. Panic students and faculties ran for their lives. Police say the suspected shooter was a twenty-four-year-old student, he took aim from a campus roof top. Students were warned to stay put while some desperately took cover on a ledge, others jumped to safety. Police say at least fourteen people were killed and twenty-five injured.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 12.20.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.20.23/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Dec 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.20.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with new details about a major prisoner swap between the US and Venezuela. Ten Americans including several the US considered wrongfully detained were released from that South American country today in exchange for a close ally of Venezuela President N.M, a leader who himself is under US indictment for narco trafficking. As part of the deal, an American fugitive known as Fat L, who fled the country before being sentenced for his role in a bribery and corruption case will be sent back to the US to face justice. The deal is one step in President B’s latest effort to improve relations with M’s Venezuela after offering sanctions relief this fall. That country is the source of the largest migrant crisis in the western hemisphere directly impacting the US border.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, B administration sent a convicted murderer back to Russia in exchange for WNBA star B.G. This time, it was someone accused of money laundering. But ten Americans are now home and a big fugitive is back in custody. President B tonight heralding a deal that caps seven months of talks to get back detained Americans. Among the released, E.H, a public defender from Los Angeles who’d been detained since March, 2022, before his release, H sent a letter to the President’s asking for help and recorded this audio message obtained exclusively by CBSN. Also coming back to the US, L.F, widely known as Fat L who had been awaiting sentencing for overseeing one of the most brazen bribery conspiracies in the US Navy history before escaping last year. A former military contractor, he pleaded guilty to bribing Nacy officer in exchange for classified information and for overcharging the military by millions. In exchange, the US sent back A.S, someone close to M accused by the US prosecutors of money laundering on behalf of M’s government. President B defended that move tonight.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 12.19.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.19.23/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Dec 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.19.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;There is breaking news out of Colorado where the state’s supreme court just ruled that D.T is disqualified to be president under the insurrection clause of the constitution. We are going to have more on that news in just a moment. But we do want to begin with weather because just one week before Christmas, hundreds of thousands of Americans are without power tonight after what the National Weather Service is calling a one-hundred-year flood. An intense storm pummeled northeast and is still causing problems. Four states are experiencing major floodings tonight. Rivers are still rising and inundating neighborhoods. Rescue teams tonight are looking people out of their homes and cars. So far, the storm is blamed for at least five deaths from Florida to New England.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The massive amount of rainfall saw in this part of the country caused the Passaic River go from picturesque to panic inducing. It’s overflowing its banks, triggering flood warnings, and, of course, putting lives at risk. It’s a post-storm scene we are seeing repeated throughout the northeast. The deadly storm system left scenes of flooding, buckled roads, and downed powerlines in its wake from mid-Atlantic to the northeast. In Jackson Falls, New Hampshire, newly melted snow fueled raging rivers and floods. First responders were using drones to search for two people missing in Mexico, Maine.

Two people were killed by falling trees in New England. In Michigan, this intense system causes massive pileup on Interstate 94 near Kalamazoo. Near whiteout conditions and blinding snow caused multiple crashes, leaving cars and people stranded. So, from the road to the sky, major disruptions at US airports. Today, more than four thousand flights delayed and more than five canceled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, this storm has many holiday travelers struggling to get their destinations and we learn today about the record fine that Southwest is paying for last year’s holiday travel meltdown.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 12.17.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.17.23/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Dec 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.17.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We’ll have the latest from the Middle East including C.D’s look inside a tunnel under Gaza that Israel claims Hamas built for a large scale attack. But first, a powerful storm is roaring up the East Coast right now. It’s set to wreak havoc for millions of you ahead of the holiday season. Fierce winds, even tornadoes are possible. Flooding is also a major threat. You can see right their parts of Florida to the Carolinas are all already swamped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The storm as you just heard could make travelling a little tougher this week. AAA predicts one hundred and fifteen million people will be on the move this holiday season. Most would travel by road; more than seven million others are expected to fly. The good news though, gas prices are down, tonight a gallon of regular averages three dollars and seven cents nationwide. That is the lowest price in two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, to the Middle East, tonight Israel is confronting new questions over its military strategy in Gaza as the international outcry over civilian deaths in the territory grows. There is also mounting desperation inside Gaza. Take a look at these images today. Food trucks entering from Egypt are raided amid a severe food shortage. This week, Defense Secretary L.A travels to Israel as the US pushes leaders there to scale back the war.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 12.16.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.16.23/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Dec 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.16.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;On the nineth day before Christmas, major storm systems threatened both coasts and could make a mess of holiday plan. Tonight, a big storm is making its way from Florida to New Jersey. Thirty-seven million people will be under storm warnings and watches. Places like Myrtle Beach are bracing for what is to come as the storm heads north. And out west, California is set for a drenching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the Middle East now, tonight, there is new criticism of Israel following the deaths of civilians in Gaza. They include two women killed by an Israeli sniper. The elderly woman and her daughter had taken refuge with others inside a Catholic church in the territory. Tonight, there are also new revelation about the deaths of three Israeli hostages killed in Gaza by Israeli troops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here in Tel-Aviv hostage square, people are just devastated and Israeli military officials told CBSN that in those hostages’ last moment of life, they were carrying a stick with white cloth and Israeli troops feeling threatened, opened fired.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 12.15.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.15.23/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Dec 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.15.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with breaking news about the man once known as America’s mayor. R.G tonight ordered to pay a staggering amount of money, nearly one hundred and fifty million dollars to two former Georgia election workers. A federal judge ruled D.T then personal lawyer defamed R.F and S.M by spreading lies that they engaged in an election fraud. The two women say their lives were turned upside down. They were threatened with lynchings and stalked. These two poll workers fulfilling a public service and ensuring American rights to vote. Now, they feel they can’t return home and had to change their appearances to stay safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R.G didn’t bat an eye as the jury announced its decision, but it’s the size of the damages that caused a bit of stir here at the courthouse. An epic fall for the man who was Time’s Person of the Year. A jury stood witness to what R.G did to me and my daughter. R.F and her daughter S.M emerged triumphantly from court today after a jury awarded them damages from R.G for the conspiracy theories he spread about them since the 2020 election. G was found liable for defaming the women and for inflicting emotional distress for lies claiming they flipped votes while serving as Georgia election workers in 2020 including a conspiracy theory the women exchanged USB drive to do so when they were actually exchanging a mint. The lies led to vile threats. The total awarded to the two women includes more than thirty-three million dollars in compensatory damages, forty million for intentionally infliction of emotional distress and then a number that drew some gasps in the courthouse, seventy-five million in punitive damages. G who had said he planned to testify at this trial, opted not to at the last minute. Outside the courthouse, he continued to spread baseless claims about the election in 2020. G told us he is going to appeal. An appeal in the federal system can be lengthy which means it is not clear when or if either woman will get any money.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 12.14.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.14.23/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Dec 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.14.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We want to begin tonight with the fresh warnings from President B to Israel that it is time to scale back the war in Gaza and quote, “be more careful to protect civilians”. We’ve got more on that message in just a moment. But first, the world is on alert amid growing fears of terror attacks inspired by the Israel-Hamas war. We’ve got important new information tonight about the suspected terror plots against Jewish targets in Europe that were foiled. Seven people were arrested by police, the first sign that the war in Gaza maybe spreading on the region. Israeli Prime Minister B.N said the suspects were acting on behalf of Hamas. The arrests come just one day after a senior Hamas official called for violence against Americans everywhere. And the FBI, in just last couple of days warning of a heightened threat of lone actors targeting large holiday gatherings right here in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security is being ramped up tonight in parts of Europe. Denmark announcing higher police patrols in Jewish sites in Copenhagen. The Danish Prime Minister saying the threat is as serious as it gets. The accusation tonight that those terror suspects have direct ties in the same militant group is Israeli forces have been battling since the Oct.7 massacre that killed more than one thousand two hundred people there. German anti-terror teams say they arrested three men in Berlin, while police in the Netherlands, detained a suspect in Rotterdam, all accused of being longstanding Hamas members, connected to its military wing. Denmark also announcing arrests although it is not clear whether they are connected. Following raids, prosecutors say the suspects planned to store weapons in Berlin, for possible attacks against Jewish targets in Europe. Danish intelligence officials saying today the investigation revealed a network of people preparing a terrorist act.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 12.13.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.13.23/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Dec 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.13.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We want to begin tonight with the breaking news here in Washington on Capitol Hill where just a short time ago Republicans in the House voted to begin a formal impeachment inquiry into President B. This next step follows the years-long scrutiny of the president and his family that has turned up no proof of high crimes and misdemeanors. Democrats tonight are calling the move by Republicans an extreme political stunt that has no credibility and no legitimacy. Well, today’s vote comes as same day that H.B showed up on Capitol Hill, not to testify but to blast Republicans for what he said were attacks on him to embarrass and damage his father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was just hours after the president’s son made that dramatic appearance outside the Capitol defending his father that House Republicans launched an effort to impeach the President. A party vote line tonight will launch another attempt to impeach US president. Republicans approved a formal impeachment inquiry alleging President B might have benefited from his son’s foreign business dealings and has stonewalled them.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 12.12.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.12.23/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Dec 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.12.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Today is especially busy for President B who is handling a number of foreign policy crises. One of those critical global security issues, the Israel-Hamas war. Today, the president’s harshest words yet, saying privately, but many of his own party have been urging him to say publicly. Israel needs to change how it is fighting this war because the country is losing international support. But Israel shows no signs of slowing down, today reportedly beginning an effort to start flooding those tunnels, more on that in just a moment. First, the big news here in Washington. Ukraine’s President Z in town making the case that Ukraine needs billions more in military funding or Russia will win the war and push even further into Europe. Republicans say their focus is the US border. Without policy changes there, more money for Ukraine won’t happen. Lawmakers leave Washington Friday for the holiday, so time is running out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President B personally invited President Z to come to Washington and directly urge Congress to act quickly on more funding. But tonight, it looks like the face-to-face sales pitch didn’t work. Tonight, a plea from President V.Z to the United States. The Ukrainian leader praised his country’s battlefield success noting it has taken back fifty percent of land seized by Russia. And in a bid to win over Republican skeptics, ninety percent of American security aid is being spent by the defense industry in the US. Standing by President Z, President B blasted Republicans for slowing the aid. But Ukrainian leader’s visit did little to win over Republicans who say the aid likely won’t be approved by the end of the year. Despite the Pentagon warning it is running low funds to Ukraine. The GOP has said it will only support Ukraine in exchange for the B administration agreeing to changes in southern border security amid a record number of illegal crossing in recent weeks. CBSN has learned the White House is telling lawmakers it might be willing to support new polices to expel migrants without asylum screenings. What to do about the border is part of a bigger negotiation to provide another sixty-one billion dollars to Ukraine through next fall, plus more for Israel and Taiwan. In Russia, a Kremlin spokesman said it would be watching the B Z meeting very carefully.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 12.11.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.11.23/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Dec 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.11.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, we begin with breaking news. The Supreme Court just moments ago taking a step forward in a historic case involving D.T. Late this afternoon, the Supreme Court agreeing to hear an extraordinary petition from Special Counsel J.S who is pursing a criminal prosecution of T for his attempts to overturn 2020 election. The nation’s highest court is now set to weigh in for the first time on the historic criminal prosecution of a former president. And the special counsel is asking the justices to break from tradition and decide quickly on whether D.T has immunity. Now here is what the special counsel wrote in the petition: this case presents a fundamental question at the heart of our democracy whether a former president is absolutely immune from federal prosecution for crimes committed while in office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J.S is looking into the future knows when the January 6th trial begins next year former President T will claim it’s illegal and tried to raise that with the highest court, that view is backed up by our sources who say T is pushing his lawyers to appeal, appeal and appeal and argue he should be immune from prosecution about his alleged conduct while serving as president. But S is trying to get ahead of T’s strategy to make sure he is on solid ground legally and won’t be delayed by a flurry of motions from T. T’s team pushed back against him today saying S is attempting to bypass the appeal process they now have until December to respond before the high court weighs in if they do it all.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 12.10.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.10.23/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Dec 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.10.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight in central Tennessee where powerful storms killed at least six people and unleashed a trail of terror in the state. Tonight, crews are still digging out from the rubble after an outbreak of tornadoes flipped trucks, flatten homes and toppled powerlines. Tens of thousands of people are still without power right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this neighborhood, powerlines and poles were toppled and homes are now missing entire sections. It’s also in this area where three people were killed including a child. There was little doubt as the intense storm flew through middle Tennessee that these incredibly large funnel clouds near the heart of Nashville would cause major damage. This is the rubble left in its wake, devastating, deadly, and widespread. The damage is heaviest in Clarksville and in Hendersonville where little is left of this antique mart. Tonight, those here to salvaging what they can, cleaning up and taking stock. Crews have been deployed to these hard hit neighborhoods to try to restore power, but at last check, more than twenty thousand customers were still without electricity and temperatures are expected to dip below freezing overnight.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 12.09.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.09.23/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Dec 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.09.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;It is a rough weekend across the nation with severe weather from coast to coast. This tornado terrified people northwest of Nashville, knocking down trees and powerlines. Dime-sized hail battered Arkansas, and now all that soaking rain and wind are heading northeast. While out west, they’re dealing with snow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strong, severe thunderstorm, heavy rain damaging winds around as we head overnight and into your Sunday as well. So heavy downpours, flash floodings observed, but everyone dealing with the gusty winds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Israel is widening its hunt for members of Hamas as the UN says half the population in Gaza is starving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Israeli’s ambassador to the United Nations is thanking President J.B after the United States issued a veto against a UN Security Council resolution calling for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. Here in Hostage Square in Tel-Aviv, the focus though is solely on getting those one hundred or so abductees still in Gaza home. Israel maintains that military pressure will make that happen faster.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 12.08.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.08.23/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Dec 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.08.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with the very serious criminal charges facing the president’s son, H.B. The indictment coming down last night is breath taking in scope about how the Yale trained lawyer allegedly spent years skimming to avoid more than a million dollars in taxes. Or in the words of prosecutors “living in extravagant live style”. This fifty-six-page indictment includes numerous salacious details including how he spent his money on escorts and girlfriends. It’s important to know that H.B has admitted a decades-long addiction problem to drugs and alcohol, getting worse after the death of his only brother B. Reality is now H.B two criminal trials as his father seeks re-election to the White House. In September, B was indicted by a separate grand jury in charges of lying about being a drug user on an application to buy a handgun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legal experts tell CBSN the felony charges against H.B are serious and the court paper contains graphic allegations as the White House keeps his distance from the case. Leaving the White House for campaign stops in California, President B ignored questions about his son’s felony and misdemeanor tax charges. The fifty-six-page indictment details an alleged four-year-scheme to avoid paying at least 1.4 million in federal taxes. H.B is charged with nine counts including tax evasion. The special counsel D.W included eye-popping details about B alleged spending. 1.6 million in cash from ATM withdrawals, six hundred and eighty-three thousand in payment to various women and thirty-nine thousand for home help, cleaning and childcare.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 12.07.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.07.23/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Dec 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.07.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;H.B was just indicted by a federal grand jury in California now facing new charges. In September, H was indicted by another federal grand jury in Delaware on felony charges for allegedly lying about being a drug user on an application to buy a gun. He pleaded not guilty on those charges. B had entered into a plea agreement with the Justice Department on two misdemeanor tax charges, but remember, that deal collapsed after facing scrutiny from a US district court judge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the fifty-six-page court filing, a federal grand jury in California has returned nine count indictments, charging H.B with three felony tax offenses and six misdemeanor tax charges. The sprawling indictment alleges the president’s son engaged in a four-year scheme to avoid paying on at least 1.4 million dollars in federal taxes. He is also accused of taking false business deductions to reduce his tax liability. The indictment says he spent millions on an extravagant lifestyle, including drugs, escorts, luxury hotels and exotic cars rather than paying the IRS. The case was brought in California because H.B lived there when the alleged crimes were committed. The president’s son is already facing three felony gun charges in Delaware for allegedly lying about his drug use to purchase weapons in 2018. In a statement, H.B’s lawyer said “based on the facts and the law, if H’s name was anything other than B, the charges in Delaware now California would not have been brought.” If convicted, he could face up to seventeen years in prison.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 12.06.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.06.23/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Dec 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.06.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We want to begin tonight with new developments in a shooting on a college campus just hours ago. We are just learning from law enforcement that multiple people were killed after a gunman opened fire inside the Business School at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Tonight, we have new reporting on the gunman and we’ll hear from students who barricaded themselves inside classrooms to stay safe. The active shooter not only caused a lockdown on campus, but a temporary shutdown of the airport in Las Vegas, which is just miles from the strip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sirens blared through the streets of Las Vegas as officers responded to reports of an active shooter at UNLV shortly before noon. Campus police sent out alerts to students and faculty, telling them about shoots being fired in the Beam Hall building and ordering them to run, hide, fight. As the campus of more than thirty thousand remained on lockdown, those off campus used their phones to keep contact with panic loved ones. Some students were let out in formation as others reunited with families.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 12.05.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.05.23/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Dec 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.05.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We want to begin tonight with breaking news about America’s national security and the warnings from the FBI to local state and federal law enforcement about the possibility of terror attacks right here on the homeland. CBSN got a look at a new joint bulletin that warns that groups like al-Qaeda and ISIS will likely use Israel-Hamas war to increase calls for violence in the US this holiday season. The bulletin says the most likely primary targets could include churches, synagogues and the members of Jewish community. Today, the FBI director was telling senators that the US is facing the highest risk of attack in years, that there are blinking lights everywhere and warning terrorists will exploit the southern border. The head of the FBI says the bureau is working to identify and disrupt these potential attacks with foreign terrorist groups openly calling for strikes against Americans. He also said the number of threats is at a whole other level since the Oct.7th attack on Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intelligence chatter is almost elevated during the holiday, but this year government analysts expect heightened rhetoric, with terrorist groups and their media outlets latching onto the conflict. With Israeli military bearing down on southern Gaza and Hanukkah only days away, the new intelligence report, reviewed by CBSN, warns of increased threats from foreign terrorist groups and mirrors FBI Director C.W’s testimony today on Capitol Hill. In stark language, the intelligence report predicts ISIS and al-Qaeda will likely use the Middle East conflict to increase calls for violence in the US this holiday season compared to prior years as new details emerge about alleged pilot to attack Las Vegas. Authorities arrested a sixteen-year-old suspect who allegedly wrote on social media about launching a lone wolf attack in support of ISIS. A home-made flag and other articles allegedly recovered along with bomb parts. On Capitol Hill, a stark warning from the FBI chief. With the spike in threats since the war began, the intelligence report warns “civilian casualties in Gaza whether real, perceived, or falsified or the increased presence of US military forces in direct support of Israel” will likely be exploited by terrorist groups.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 12.03.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.03.23/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Dec 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.03.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin this Sunday in the Middle East. Tonight, Israel is widening its hunt for Hamas leaders to southern Gaza, where the majority of the territory’s population is now crowded. For civilians, there is no escape. There is panic and confusion, as you can imagine as Israel intensifies its airstrikes across the territory and expands its ground offensive. This hospital overwhelmed by the dead and the wounded. Elsewhere, horrific scenes of destruction. Casualties appear to be heaviest in the already hard-hit north. These siblings mourning to the death of their father and mother killed in Israeli airstrike. Also today, a US Navy warship in the Red Sea responded to drone attacks against three separate commercial ships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister B.N says he will continue to negotiate but will not let up in the ground war, insisting that gives Israel more leverage to free the more than one hundred and thirty hostages including eight Americans who remain in the clutches of Hamas. It has been eight weeks since Hamas took some two hundred and forty hostages. Now, for the first time, many of those freed described their torment in detail. Desperate for food and air in Hamas’s tunnels. A horror film that terrified their families at home as well. But for now, there are no more hostages being released but the ceasefire and the lives of Gazans in shambles. In northern Gaza, an airstrike let these boys screaming and searching for their father among the debris. The UN says some seventy-five percent Palestinians are now displaced in the strip. As Israeli forces push south, in their vow to destroy Hamas, many Gazans are fleeing toward the border with Egypt, where they build makeshift shelter.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 12.02.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.02.23/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Dec 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.02.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, a new warning for Israel from the United States. Defense Secretary L.A says Israel must protect Gaza’s civilian population or risk driving them into “the arms of the enemy”. Today, Israel intensifies its airstrikes in the Palestinian territory. Also, today health officials in Hamas-run Gaza said the death toll there now tops fifteen thousand. And in his first public comments since the end of the temporary ceasefire, Israeli Prime Minister B.N said troops are preparing for “total victory”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That broken ceasefire means that Palestinian prisoners are no longer being exchange for Israeli hostages leaving the families of those hostages gather here at this rally in a state of dread over their fate in the next stage of this war. Today marks eight weeks since Hamas kidnapped some two hundred and forty hostages including the B’s family. With the collapse of the ceasefire, the hostages and the people of Gaza are once again caught in the crucible of the war. Heeding calls from Israel to evacuate, Palestinians flee Khan Younis in the south, others clamor and sift through the rubble. At the Shuhada Al-aqsa Hospital, women and children rush for treatment and safety. Despite the bombing, Israel says it will facilitate the entry of aid into Gaza. But the Red Cross says that will be difficult because everything in Gaza is at a breaking point.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 12.01.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.01.23/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Dec 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.01.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin with history in the House of Representatives and expulsion of Republican G.S from the halls of Congress. What happened today was rare since the first Congress of 1789 with eleven thousand lawmakers have served in the House and just five expelled. That is until today S is now the sixth. What also is rare is the bipartisan vote like we saw today. Two weeks ago, the House Ethics Committee released a scathing report that even S’s fellow Republicans could not ignore. Some of the details were surprising, the committee accused the New Yorker of using campaign money to pay personal credit card bills and to shop in Sephora even allegedly spending thousands of dollars at Hermes. Getting kicked out of Congress isn’t the thirty-five-year-old’s only concern, he could still face decades in prison for nearly two dozen federal charges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Congress that already made history with the first ever removal of US House Speaker and two near government shutdowns. Today? Expel one of its own. G.S began putting on his coat even as the vote to expel him was still underway. Chased by reporters and riding off from the Capitol in a Jaguar as a former Congressman. His final remark reportedly “Why would I want to stay here? To hell with this place”. Dozens of his fellow Republicans joined nearly all Democrats voting to make S one of only three US House members to be expelled since the US civil war as Congressional maintenance crews changed the lock of his doors and removed his nameplate. Members of both parties who labeled S as a crooked and a distraction celebrated the move&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 11.30.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.30.23/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Dec 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.30.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;After fifty-five long and grueling days, eight more hostages are back with their loved ones tonight. Last-minute tense negotiations allowed for a seventh day of this temporary ceasefire and for more families to be reunited. In exchange, Israel freed thirty Palestinian prisoners. There were six women and two teenagers who crossed out of Gaza today. Many of them were hiding in their homes during the Hamas terror attack. And while they are free tonight, their loved ones are still being held captive. And despite a pause in fighting in Gaza, there was violence in Jerusalem today. Two gunmen opened fire during the morning commute on a crowd waiting to board a bus. Now, Hamas is claiming responsibility for the terror attack that killed at least three Israelis and wounded six others including two Americans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exchange of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners continues, ensuring a fragile peace in the Gaza strip. But blood continues to be spilled both in the West Bank and here in Jerusalem, where two Americans are among the wounded. A tearful reunion nearly eight excruciating weeks in the making. With the extension of the ceasefire and resuming of the war delayed one more day, Secretary of State A.B, during his visit to the region, cautioned Israel. But new signs of the conflict boiling over into the West Bank. CCTV tape shows the moment Hamas terrorists, armed with an M-16 and handgun, opened fire on civilians waiting at the bus stop outside an entrance to Jerusalem. Police say several were injured including two Americans and at least four were killed. Violent incidents have been growing for days. Hamas claims the act was a response to the killing of children in the Palestinian refugee camp Jenin, such as two boys yesterday, age eight and fifteen.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 11.29.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.29.23/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Nov 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.29.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with major news out of the Middle East on this sixty day of the temporary ceasefire between Israel and Hamas and we’re just hours away from the end of that pause in fighting, unless a last-minute deal is reached. Well, today, American citizens were just released from captivity in Gaza as part of the latest group of hostages freed by Hamas. The forty-nine-year-old woman who holds dual US and Israeli citizenship was one of sixteen hostages released today. That includes ten Israelis, four Thai citizens and two Russians. Thirty Palestinian prisoners were handed over as part of the latest exchange. Now this brings the total hostage freed during the truce to ninety-seven. That means about a hundred and fifty are still detained. All this at this hour the international team of mediators, including from the US and Qatar are working around the clock to extend the pause of fighting for several more days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And just moments ago, we saw secretary A.B motorcade arrive here in Tel-Aviv all part of the US’s efforts to extend the ceasefire to increase aid to Gaza and of course to free all of the hostages. And tonight, the leader from Hamas telling CBSN that they are willing to release every hostage that includes men and soldiers in exchange for every Palestinian prisoner. The sixth wave of hostage release included an American woman, L.B who was freed from captivity. But for her father, Y, the joy isn’t complete. Her sister, T, flew from Portland, Oregon for the reunion. And tonight, they heard from the president. R and her daughter L. separated in captivity just before the thirteen-year-old released Saturday are expected to be together again tonight. The fate of eight more American hostages hangs in the balance. And tonight, a devastating blow to all who awaited to the news on the release of the B family.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 11.28.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.28.23/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Nov 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.28.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We want to begin tonight with the nation’s goodbye to former First Lady R.C. Hundreds were in attendance for a powerful memorial service in Atlanta. Ninety-nine-year-old, former President J.C made a rare public appearance to pay his respects to his beloved wife. Remember, they were together for more than ¾ of the century. President B and First Lady sat right there on the front row with former President B.C and all the living former First Ladies on this second day of a three-day tribute to her life and legacy. The Georgia native and devout Christian was remembered for her love of family, her humanitarian work and her tireless dedication of others. The trailblazing First Lady died last week at the age of ninety-six after battle with dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Family, friends, former presidents, all here and the only mystery going in was whether J.C would feel strong enough to join them, and he did. Inseparable once again, R.C and her husband J.C, the thirty-nineth president, a frail ninety-nine draped in a blanket embroidered with their images. She was Plains-born, Plains-spoken, from her days as first lady to a half-century of globetrotting as a voice for the voiceless. The Carters shared a great American love story, married for seventy-seven years. Tomorrow’s funeral will be small and private. R.C will be buried in Plains on the family property.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 11.27.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.27.23/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Nov 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.27.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We’re going to begin tonight with big news out of the Middle East. Israel and Hamas have agreed to extend their pause in fighting for two more days. The deal is expected to follow the same conditions as the original temporary ceasefire. Three Palestinian prisoners released for every Israeli hostage freed. These are the faces of sixty-nine hostages all kidnapped during Hamas terror attacks on Oct.7th, who have been freed. Fifty of the hostages were released under this deal that the US helped broker, and thirty of them are children. Now on Sunday, the hostage for prisoners exchange included the freeing of the youngest American captive four-year-old A.E. The agreement has also freed a hundred and fifty Palestinian prisoners. And in Israel today, we saw E.M touring Kfar Aza, visiting the house where A was kidnapped and her parents were murdered in front of her. The trip comes after the faced international backlash for endorsing an antisemitic post. M was scolded by Israel President over the content on his social media platform X.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The temporary ceasefire was due to end tomorrow morning at 7:00 local time, but tonight, Hamas confirmed to CBSN that it’s committed to releasing twenty more hostages in return for two-day extension of the ceasefire as this evening, another group of captives has been freed. Another eleven hostages were released by Hamas tonight including eight children. The youngest, a pair of twins, just three years old. In Israel, there’s more joy and more relief.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 11.26.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.26.23/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Nov 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.26.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with the latest developments in the Middle East. Hamas is now seeking to extend the four-day temporary truce set to expired Monday. It follows the third exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners. Today, the first Americans hostage was released, a four-year-old-girl. Of the seventeen hostages returned to Israel Sunday, these images are reunions and relief just a portion of the two hundred and forty hostages seized by Hamas. As part of the truce deal, aid is flowing into Gaza. Israel says two hundred trucks entered the territory today through the crossing with Egypt. Also in Gaza, Prime Minister B.N visited Israeli troops, vowing to fight Hamas quote “until victory”. In London, tens of thousands demonstrated against antisemitism. The rally coming amid a steep rise in hate crimes. For now, a noticeable change in Gaza, the longest break in fighting since Oct.7th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After fifty-one days in captivity, four-year-old American Israeli A.E is finally freed with President B saying she had endured the unthinkable. A sea of Israeli flags greeted the minibuses carrying the latest hostages released from Gaza. This third wave of captives, let go as part of the deal between Israel and Hamas was the smoothest exchange yet and included the first American. Four-year-old A.E. In a statement, her family said there was, quote “no words” to express the relief and gratitude at her release. Both E’s mother and father were killed by Hamas gunman on Oct.7th, and she will now be cared by relatives.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 11.25.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.25.23/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Nov 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.25.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, the second group of hostages held by Hamas has been freed but not before a new Hamas’ demand, delayed the handover for ours. This release did not include Americans. Thirteen Israelis and four Thai nationals were taken from Gaza across the border to Egypt. In exchange, dozens of Palestinian prisoners were expected to be freed. Today, more aid flowed into Gaza as part of the four-days truce agreement, but it is still far short of what has been called for. And in Tel-Aviv tonight, thousands of Israelis rallied to keep pressure on Prime Minister B.N to secure the release of all the hostages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hostages are now back Israel and we finally know who they are. In this group, mothers and children, a three-year-old, two teen siblings whose mother was murder on Oct.7th, a twenty-one-year-old who attended the music festival among others. In one case, there is a teen who was released but her mother who was also abducted has not been released. Tonight, a delayed release of thirteen more Israeli women and children and four Thai nationals held by Hamas in exchange for thirty-nine Palestinians in prison in Israeli jail, ending a brief but tense standoff and fears of a four-day ceasefire cut short. Friday, the images of the first twenty-four hostages being released and the emotional family unions. But on day two, the fragile truce was on trouble. For long hours, Hamas halted the release of the second group of the hostages accusing Israel of not fulfilling terms of the deal by preventing the agreed number of eight trucks from reaching northern Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 11.24.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.24.23/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Nov 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.24.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with the long-awaited release of some of the hostages kidnapped by Hamas. They were freed early this morning, after seven excruciating weeks of captivity inside Gaza. Those released include thirteen Israelis, ten Thai citizens, and one Filipino citizen. The Israeli range in age from a two-year-old girl to an eighty-five-year-old great grandmother. Almost all of them were kidnapped from the same community. More than two hundred remain in captivity in Gaza. The freed hostages were handed over to the Red Cross as part of an agreement that required Israel to release thirty-nine Palestinian prisoners. President B said today’s events were the result of extensive US diplomacy and that more hostages, including some Americans are expected to be released in the days ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you imagine, the anticipation of for this moment for this truce and the release of hostages has been extraordinary. And today, just a small fraction of the families of hostages got to experience what every single one of them has been yearning for to see them in person and alive. Tonight, twenty-four hostages including thirteen Israelis held by Hamas crossed to safety. The sights of their faces traveling into Egypt inside Red Cross trucks brought a sigh of relief to some family members. Day one of the ceasefire began as planned, at 7:00AM allowing hundreds of aid trucks carrying fuel and supplies to reach Gaza in desperate need. But just an hour into the temporary truce, shots fired. CBSN captured the moments Israeli soldiers shot and killed at least two Palestinians injuring several others to block them from returning to evacuated northern Gaza. By 4:00AM, the hostages were in buses to Israel where their first stop was a military base for a health assessment. And then onto helicopters bound for hospitals and their waiting families.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 11.23.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.23.23/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Nov 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.23.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin this Thanksgiving with law enforcement agencies across the country on high alert as the war in the Middle East leads to increase concerns about terrorism in the US. A recent multiagency terrorism assessment reviewed by CBSN shows a heightened-threat environment. Targets of concern include public events, like today’s Thanksgiving Day parade in New York City, events with significant crowds and lots of media coverage. A group of Palestinian protesters briefly disrupted the parade today but they were quickly led away by police.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even hours after a successful kickoff to the holiday season, the streets here are just now reopening, highlighting the heightened security measures NYPD is taking here. From the dazzling floats and A-list performances to SpongeBob SquarePants, the massive Pillsbury Doughboy, and, of course Snoopy, millions of people packed the New York City streets to catch a glimpse of their favorite characters soaring through the sky. And this year, security was as high as the balloons, a response to the high concerns over terror threats. Temporarily pausing the parade, demonstrators calling for aa cease fire in Gaza. A security assessment reviewed by CBSN suggests a heightened threat environment related to the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas. It points to foreign organizations calling for attacks on group gatherings and other public events in US, with a focus on New York State.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 11.22.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.22.23/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Nov 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.22.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Turning overseas now to the breakthrough deal between Israel and Hamas for the long-waited release of hostages. We are learning tonight that no hostages will be freed and until at least Friday. That’s what Hamas is expected to begin releasing fifty women and children in exchange for one hundred fifty Palestinian women and teenagers being held by Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight, Israel’s Prime Minister B.N vowed to bring home all of the hostages calling it a sacred mission. Under the deal, Hamas is incentivized to release four of its captives. Every ten extra hostages freed will extend the temporary cease fire by a day. In Gaza, some residents told CBSN a four-day pause in fighting isn’t enough. In Israel, the families of the hostages have endured anxiety and heartbreak for more than six weeks, but with hope on the horizon, today a group of their supporters sang songs of peace in central Tel-Aviv. Israel’s military said tonight that the hostage release procedure has not yet been finalized. But one detail we do have is that the Red Cross will be able to visit those hostages who are not released and take them medicine.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 11.21.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.21.23/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Nov 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.21.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with breaking news with Israel and Hamas agreeing on a deal that will free a number of hostages in Gaza in exchange for a temporary pause in fighting. The long-anticipated agreement is for the release of fifty hostages, mainly women and children. In addition to the four-day pause in fighting, the deal includes the freeing of at least one hundred one hundred Palestinian prisoners currently being held by Israel. The number of hostages freed could increase in the days ahead. Today’s news comes as we learned fourteen thousand people have been killed in Gaza according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Tonight, Israel is preparing to escalate the war by moving its devastating ground invasion from northern Gaza further south. Israeli Prime Minister B.N today announced that the military’s push into southern Gaza is not a question of if, but when it will happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hamas have told us the fifty hostages they had released would all be civilians and all women and children. Around ten Americans are still unaccounted for after the Oct.7th attacks. And it’s thought some of them were taken hostage including a three-year-old girl. We don’t know at this point if they would be released. The deal was brokered by the US and Qatar. Hamas is incentivized to release more than fifty hostages with three Palestinian prisoners mainly women and children freed for every hostage who has returned to Israel. There will be a six-hour daily pause in fighting for four days which could be extended during which Israel’s aerial surveillance will be halted. And three hundred trucks each day will carry aid including cooking oil and fuel for hospitals into the Gaza Strip. But tonight, Israel’s Prime Minister B.N vowed this won’t be the end of the war, saying his country will continue fighting until it has eliminated Hamas. Israel says there are two hundred thirty-six hostages, only four have been released until now while Israel’s military have retrieved the bodies of two others from Gaza and rescue one soldier who had been taken captive.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 11.20.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.20.23/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Nov 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.20.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin with the holiday travel rush kicking into high gear, but severe weather could cause chaos at airports and on the roads. AAA estimates a near record number of Americans, fifty-five millions, will travel more than fifty miles from their home this year with a majority of them driving to their Thanksgiving Day destinations. A major storm system, however, moving across the country could bring travel disruptions from the southern plains to the northeast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Millions of Americans are already on the move for Thanksgiving trying to beat the rush they’re caught up in the middle of. Now, so far, it’s moved pretty well, only about sixty flights cancelation today for example. But the weather becomes a big question mark starting tomorrow. The holiday travel time is now. J.G and J.R’s family left Miami early to beat the Thanksgiving travel rush heading for Paris. Airlines expect their busiest Thanksgiving ever. Since Thursday, more than ten million have already passed through TSA checkpoints, well ahead of 2019 prepandemic numbers. With nearly fifty thousand scheduled flights expected Wednesday alone, the FAA is opening an extra airspace along the east coast usually reserved for military. AAA expects most Americans to take their Turkey trip on the road, fueled by gas prices $0.37 cheaper than last year.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 11.19.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.19.23/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Nov 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.19.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with the death of former First Lady, R.C, she died today at her home in Plains, Georgia after a life committed to public service long after leaving Washington. Mrs. C was ninety-six years old. No other first couple lived longer after leaving the White House than J. and R.C, forty-three years. And no first couple was married longer, seventy-seven years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J. and R.C had a partnership that was extraordinary for a president and first lady. The C’s bond was deep both in private and in politics. She spoke her mind to her husband and he valued her advice. She said it on cabinet meetings, a first, and took the heat for it. Born in Plains, Georgia, August 18th 1927, the oldest of four children she started dating J.C when she was eighteen. They married a year later; J was in the Navy which allowed them to see the world. When his father died in 1953 so with their three sons, they returned to Plains to run the family peanut business. In 1970, J was elected Governor of Georgia. R. campaigned by his side and on her own that continued on the 1976 presidential trail with their fourth child A. often joined them. As First Lady, she continued to be a sounding board for her husband. She also traveled as an emissary especially to Latin America. After leaving Washington in 1981 they then created C. Center in Atlanta with promoted peace and where she can continue her work as an advocate for research and treatment of mental illness.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 11.18.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.18.23/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Nov 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.18.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin this Saturday with the war between Israel and Hamas and more scenes of total chaos. Palestinian officials say two explosions killed dozens of civilians in the district of Jabalia. One of them at an UN-run school at a refugee camp. And in Israel, tens of thousands are marching to confront their government over the fight of hostages seized by Hamas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, for the hundreds of Palestinians who had to flee Gaza’s largest hospital they face a very uncertain futures as Israel’s deadly bombings across the besieged territory show no end, while tens of thousands Israeli have taken to the streets to demand their government do more to bring their loved ones being held hostage in Gaza home. Through Gaza city’s mangled streets, families, many with small children, run for their lives. Israel denies making the evacuation order, but as hundreds fled the medical facility, several holding makeshift white flags, Israeli sniper fire crackled nearby. Israel’s armed forces seized Al Shifa hospital earlier this week after accusing Hamas of running a command center beneath it, but has so far provided limited evidence calling into question Israel’s justification for targeting the largest hospital in Gaza, which now no longer functions. Most Palestinians have already fled south after seven weeks of nonstop Israeli strikes and many to their deaths.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 11.17.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.17.23/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Nov 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.17.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with the war in Gaza where Israeli troops conducted a floor-by-floor search inside Al Shifa hospital in Gaza for a third straight day. And airstrikes continue tonight on Hamas targets across the territory. The IDF says it recovered the body of a second female hostage who was kidnapped in the early hours of the October 7th attack. The nineteen-year-old Corporal was found near Gaza’s largest hospital. Tonight, CBSN has a rare look inside Al Shifa and a peek into the elaborate tunnel network dug underneath the building that Israel and the United States say has been used by Hamas. President B spoke on the phone with the leader of Qatar today whose country has relationship with Hamas to press him about the desperate need to release the hostages without further delay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, Israeli forces showed us what it said are quote, clear indications of a Hamas command center below Al Shifa hospital, an allegation that’s been central to Israel’s justification for its devastating military campaign across Gaza. It was under the cover of the darkness our journey into Gaza began. We traveled in one of Israel’s most sophisticated armored personnel carriers called the Nama or Tiger.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 11.15.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.15.23/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Nov 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.15.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with the war in Israel and Hamas escalating around the besieged Al Shifa hospital in Gaza City. Israeli troops stormed the hospital and what it calls targeted raids in a search for Hamas militants. Israel Defense Forces interrogated people inside but say they have not found any members of Hamas and found no evidence of hostages being held there. The IDF says they did find evidence of Hamas command center, and there were weapons inside the building. Israeli Prime Minister N today promising to bring hostages home and said there is no shelter or refuge for the Hamas murderers. And for the first time since the beginning of the war, fuel trucks were allowed to enter Gaza today. Israel is blocking the six thousand gallons from reaching hospitals saying the fuel can only be used by UN groups that are delivering aid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National Security Council’s J.K said today that the US did not give the green light to Israel’s raid on Al Shifa hospital which began with fiery clashes outside the complex which the military said killed four Hamas fighters. The target, Al Shifa. The decision, to send troops into the hospital marking an escalation in Israel’s offensive in Gaza. When Israeli soldiers finally entered, not a single shot was fired. But they say they found proof that Hamas was operating there showing this as evidence. What they did not show were any Hamas fighters and they made no mention of the tunnels they’ve repeatedly said double up as the group’s command center underneath the complex. Also, inside the besieged hospital civilians seeking refuge and critically ill patients. Their presence fueling international calls for a ceasefire. A place of healing turned into a battle zone. Since yesterday, medical staff have moved patients to safer areas through dust and smoke-filled corridors.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 11.15.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.15.23/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Nov 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.15.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin with several developing stories that will impact America’s national security including our exclusive interview tonight with Israeli Prime Minister B.N who we spoke with earlier today. We asked him about the ongoing negotiations with Hamas on the release of hostages in exchange for a temporarily cease fire while Israeli is facing tough questions around the world about the conduct of the war. Tonight, he answers those questions. Also today, Israeli military says it found tunnels dug beneath Gaza’s Al Shifa hospital and released video of its discovery we also speak with America’s top diplomat, Secretary of State, A.B about that historic summit between President B and China’s President X. The new deal to crack down on the chemicals that make fentanyl, the drug has caused so much pain and heartbreak here in America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With every bomb, every strike, families of the more than two hundred hostages abducted by Hamas on October 7th are reminded that nearly six weeks on, their loved ones are still being held in Gaza. Tonight, more agony, the body of 65-year-old grandmother Y.W abducted last month found in a building near Al Shifa hospital. The Israeli military continues to search that hospital where today it found more proofs, it says, that Hamas was using this as a command center including tunnel shaft and a vehicle with weapons. Al Shifa can no longer receive new patients and so they flee in their thousands, streaming southwards, setting up temporary shelter only to be told today by Israeli soldiers that they must evacuate again. But if they stay, they risk becoming part of the soaring death toll, which the Hamas run health ministry puts at around eleven thousand five hundred. That is one out of every two hundred Palestinians.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 11.14.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.14.23/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Nov 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.14.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with several developing stories, including a massive, five-vehicle crash in Ohio involving a bus full of high school students. At least six people killed and more than a dozen others. We’ll go to the scene in just a moment. But first, there is major news here in Washington about the war between Israel and Hamas. Tonight, the White House and Pentagon almost simultaneously saying that US intelligence supports Israel’s claim that Hamas has a vast tunnel system under hospitals to store weapons and hold hostages. Tonight, retired Admiral J.K, spokesman for the National Security Council told reporters aboard Air Force One that using hospitals like that would amount to a war crime. President B today had a message for the families of hostages to hang in there. And tonight, CBSN can confirm that one of those hostages is three-year-old A.E from Arizona. She is the youngest Americans being held by Hamas. Back here in Washington, tens of thousands came from all over the country for the march for Israel on the National Mall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Israeli tanks surround Gaza’s largest hospital, which US officials say is doubling as a command-and-control hub for Hamas. Still, the US urged Israel today not to fire any more munitions at Al Shifa Medical Center amid reports of incubators failing, babies dying, and a mass grave being dug on hospital grounds to dispose of dozens of bodies. Gaza is gripped by a full-blown health care crisis. In northern Gaza, there is just one functioning hospital left.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 11.13.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.13.23/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Nov 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.13.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with the war in Gaza and the hospitals caught in the middle of the fighting. Fierce battles are taking place on the doorsteps of hospitals and Palestinian health official say patients are trapped inside. The World Health Organization says Gaza’s largest hospital is surrounded by Israeli soldiers and is no longer functioning. Israel says Hamas uses Hospitals as a shield making it a legitimate military target. Take a look at this video released today by the Israeli military. They claimed that it shows a stockpile of weapons and one of the motorcycles used in the Oct.7th terror attack. Inside, the children’s hospital. While tonight, President B is saying hospitals must be protected. And today we’re learning the identities of five US service members killed when their helicopters crashed into the Eastern Mediterranean Sea during a training mission. That means the first American military deaths related to the war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And tonight, we’re learning that medical staff from Doctors without borders won’t leave Al-Shifa hospital before their six hundred or so patients have been evacuated and they want to guarantees that there is a safe corridor to do so. A sanctuary turned cemetery. At Al Shifa hospital, there is no room left in the morgue for those who could not be saved. Gaza’s health system is on its knees. Exhausted staff work in the dark with no medicine, no equipment, no hope. The Israeli military says this footage shows soldiers delivering eighty gallons of fuel to Al Shifa which they claim Hamas refused. Hamas denies this, saying it would not last longer than thirty minutes anyway. Doctors there say already at least three newborn babies have died. Dozens more seen here fighting for their lives after the incubators stopped working.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 11.12.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.12.23/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Nov 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.12.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with some breaking news. The US carried out two airstrikes on what US military official say is a training facility in the safe house in Eastern Syria. Defense Secretary L.A said the strikes were in response to Iran-linked attacks on American personnel. The strikes come four days after two US warplanes hit a munitions warehouse in the same region. Turning now to the Israel-Hamas war. Tonight, Gaza’s largest hospital is caught in the crossfire. The World Health Organization today called for urgent action to end the ongoing attacks on hospitals, saying “The world cannot stand silent while hospitals which should be safe havens, are transformed into scenes of death”. Meanwhile, CBSN has learned negotiations to free the hostages taken by Hamas are ongoing as Qatar continues to mediate dealmaking. About two hundred and forty hostages remain in Gaza following the terrorist organization’s Oct.7th raids which triggered the war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today marks thirty-seven days since those hostages were kidnapped by Hamas and now President B’s senior Middle East advisor B.M will be traveling this week to focus on efforts to release them. They came in their thousands chanting “Now, now”. Israeli demanding the immediate release of nearly two hundred and forty loved ones abducted by Hamas on Oct.7th. A remainder, when it comes to pain, there are no winners after more than five weeks of war. In Gaza City, fierce street-to-street battles around several hospitals, including the largest, Al-Shifa, now a front line.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 11.10.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.10.23/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Nov 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.10.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with mounting global pressure on Israel over the war on Gaza and the soaring number of civilian casualties. America’s top diplomat, Secretary of State A.B, joined the growing list of those who speaking out, and French President E.M was even more blunt in an interview with the BBC calling on Israel to stop killing women and babies, in his words. Prime Minister N visiting Israeli troops on this Shabbat, telling them fighting will not stop until the task is completed. Israeli tanks have surrounded hospitals in Gaza City. Israel accuses Hamas of setting up infrastructure in and around those hospital facilities. Palestinian officials say several dozen people were killed after explosions at hospitals and that the total number of deaths in Gaza now topped eleven thousand. The UN says the constant bombardment has destroyed or damaged more than forty-five percent of all of the homes in Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United Nations warning tonight that the protection of hospitals and the delivery of life-saving medical supplies is an obligation under the laws of war, and both it says, are both needed in Gaza right now. A massive strike at the Al-Shifa hospital grounds Gaza’s largest medical facility. Israel insists Hamas is using hospitals to coordinate attacks, and hide its commanders, but sheltering at Al-Shifa, thousands of civilians. Their one place of refuge now a blood-soaked battleground. Reeling in stunned disbelief, this man shouts “They bombed the hospitals”. Nearby, a younger girl breaks down, crying hysterically. Inside, doctors and nurses fight another war, the battle to keep the injured alive with virtually every critical medical supply running out. Today, at least five hospitals have been caught up in the fighting including one for children.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 11.09.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.09.23/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Nov 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.09.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with breaking news in a series of potentially deadly and targeted attacks on election workers across the country. The FBI and investigators from the US Postal Service are looking into more than a dozen letters some containing fentanyl, that were sent to election offices in at least five states. Workers in some of those offices were processing ballots from Tuesday’s election and in some cases the buildings were evacuated, interrupting the counting of votes. Since 2020 there’s been a rise in threats, harassments and intimidation of election officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight, FBI agents and postal inspectors are racing to figure out who is behind these threats. Those letters were just dropped in the mail by someone who seems to be bent on terrorizing election workers. A source familiar with the investigation tells CBSN there are more than a dozen letters being investigated addressed to election offices in Washington State, Oregon, California, Nevada, Georgia that may have been mailed from the Pacific Northwest. Initial tests show that some of the letters contain trace amounts of fentanyl, but more definitive tests are ongoing. In Georgia, where election officials have been targeted since 2020, the secretary of state says the threat is personal. Fulton County has been the recipient of numerous election-related threats over the last several years. It’s the Country where former President T has been indicted, along with eighteen others in connection with an alleged racketeering case.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 11.08.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.08.23/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Nov 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.08.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;And we begin tonight with breaking news. We’re just learning from the Pentagon about airstrikes in Eastern Syria. The target? A weapons storage facility linked to Iran and Iranian-backed groups. The Secretary of Defense revealing that the US military is responding to more than forty attacks on US Forces in Iraq and Syria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight, at the direction of President B, two F-15 fighter jets launched airstrikes in eastern Syria at the weapons facility that is used by Iran’s Revolutionary Guard and proxy forces that are backed by Iran. They were in response to attacks on US troops both Syria and Iraq over forty in the last three weeks alone that have injured nearly fifty American service members. And just today, US troops were attacked again in Syria. And in another sign of the increased signs in the region, an American Reaper Drone costing about thirty million dollars was shot down in the Red Sea by the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels. They had fired missiles last month toward Israel which were shot down by a US Naval ship. President B has repeatedly warned Iran, a longtime adversary of Israel against getting involved in the war in the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 11.07.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.07.23/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Nov 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.07.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, we’re learning that President B is personally urging Prime Minister N for a humanitarian pause in Gaza but Israel is insisting a halt in fighting will only come after the more than two hundred hostages taking by Hamas are released. It may not be the only disagreement between two allies. N saying he sees Israel playing a role in Gaza for “An indefinite period” specifically talking about a security responsibility. But you may recall, President B told Sixty Minutes it would be a big mistake if Israel occupies Gaza after the war. Well tonight, the fighting in the heart of Gaza City is intensifying. Look at these pictures. This comes as today marks one month since Hamas attack that killed more than fourteen hundred people, the deadliest attack on Jews since the Holocaust. And now thousands of civilians are fleeing Gaza City as the battle between Israel and Hamas draws closer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We saw destruction, destruction as far as the eye could see. No civilians even soldiers we were with they had seen no civilians. But they were coming up against Hamas militants. In fact, while we were there, they had to reinforce other troops for coming under fire. We joined the paratroopers of Israel’s 501st Airborne Brigade, among the first wave of forces to invade Gaza after Hamas militants went on their murderous rampage one month ago. Gunners kept looked out as we crossed the desert scrubland of northeast Gaza until we reached Beit Hanoun. As we arrived, the sound of ongoing gun battles could be heard nearby. The city had an estimated prewar population of more than sixty thousand people. Looking around, it’s hard to imagine anyone lived here at all. The commander here told us there were about a thousand Hamas militants here to begin with. Now there are a few dozen left. It’s not the threats above ground that they’re worried about, but the ones below it.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 11.06.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.06.23/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Nov 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.06.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with fireworks inside a New York City courtroom as former President D.T took the stand in the civil fraud trial against him and his company. T clashed with prosecutors and the judge when he refused to answer questions with a simply yes or no and instead went into long speeches. At one point, the judge even threatened to remove T from the witness stand ??? T and his company are accused of committing fraud by intentionally adjusting property values and inflating his personal wealth to obtain better terms on bank loans and insurance. The judge has already found and his company liable for fraud and this trial will determine how much T will have to pay in penalties. The attorney general office is seeking two hundred and fifty million dollars and to bar T and his children from doing businesses in New York. His daughter I will testify Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A dramatic tense day with voices raised and insult exchanged as former President T assailed the judge in this case. T also acknowledged the role in the evaluation of his properties. Days after his sons put the responsibility on accounts. Former President T zipped his lip in front of cameras, but on witness stand he was anything but quiet. T repeatedly lashed out at State Supreme Court Judge A.G. The man who will decide the fate of his business empire. Asked for yes or no answers by the New York State Attorney, T instead gave ??? prompting the judge to tell him “This is not a political rally, this is a courtroom”. Even pleading T’s lawyer to control him. T shook his head from the witness stand saying “This is a very unfair trial”. T and other defendants including his children have already been found liable for fraud in the case, as part of two hundred- and fifty-million-dollar law suit brought forward by New York Attorney General J. She accused T of inflating his assets including Mar-A-Lago, T Tower and his seven spring’s family estate by over two billion dollars in order to gain better financial terms. T and his sons are blaming their accountants for any errors???. When asked about the charges today, T erupted calling questions about the evaluation of Mar-A-Lago disgraceful.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 11.05.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.05.23/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Nov 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.05.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin this Sunday with Israel’s siege of Gaza and its war on Hamas. Tonight, CIA Director W.B is in Israel, part of a new push by the B administration to engage leaders in the region and to keep the war from spreading amid rising outrage over civilian deaths in the Palestinian territory. Burns joined Secretary of State A.B, already there. Today B made stops to Bagdad as well as the West Bank city of Ramallah where he held what’s being described as a tense meeting with Palestinian leader M.A. And tonight, the Israeli army said it’s “significant airstrikes and land assault had essentially split the Palestinian territory in two”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we’ve had Hamas retaliate with rockets of their own tonight here in Tel-Aviv. As for Gaza, Israel keeps shattering buildings and lives in its mission to destroy Hamas. Shock in Gaza City. An Israeli fighter jet struck this ambulance convoy claiming Hamas fighters who were inside. Men and women laid in their own pools of blood outside the strip’s biggest hospital, Al-Shifa. Israel also hit Gaza’s Jabalia refugee camp, the third time in five days, targeting more militants and infrastructures. In the aftermath, this anguished boy said he carry out dead bodies, including one decapitated. And in the Maghazi refugee camp, Hamas says another Israeli strike killed at least thirty-eight people and injured hundred more. This photojournalist carried his dead child, one of four he lost, along with four brothers and their children. Israel claims Hamas uses civilians as human shields, today releasing video, purportedly of rocket launcher pits in Gaza next to a children swimming pool and playground. And new video of Israeli police October 7th finding only dead bodies on the grass and behind the bar, riddled with bullets at the Nova music festival. In Tel-Aviv, new protests this weekend against Prime Minister B.N as anger grows in Israel at political and security leaders for last month’s deadly attack by Hamas. Many in the crowd marching toward his house chanting “jail now”. Outside the Defense Ministry, thousands demanded that all be done to bring the two hundred plus hostages held by Hamas home.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 11.03.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.03.23/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Nov 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.03.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with the spiraling violence in the Middle East. Secretary of State A.B returned to Israel today to show support for its military campaign that against the terror group Hamas while also urging Prime Minister B.N to be careful while waging that war. The US is pushing for a temporary humanitarian pause to allow for the distribution of aid in Gaza. The US says thousands of Palestinian civilians have died in the nearly month-long war. Today, N rejected any cease fire that doesn’t include the release of hostages. B, seen here leaving Israel for Jordan, is under intensifying pressure to broker a solution. Meanwhile, the Pentagon confirmed that it is conducting unarmed drone flights over Gaza in an effort to help locate the roughly two hundred and forty hostages held by Hamas. Today, an Israeli air strike hit a convoy of ambulances which Israel says Hamas uses to transport terrorists and weapons. The strike killed dozens of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re closed to the border with Lebanon, which is just under two miles in that direction. This area and the area behind me have come under repeated attack this week, and we have heard several explosions tonight on the day of Secretary of State warned regional enemies not to open up a second front. With the war in Gaza raging and Israeli forces tightening their grip on Gaza City less than fifty miles away, the Secretary of State returned to Tel-Aviv in part to persuade leaders here to allow more humanitarian pause. But Prime Minister B.N says he has no intention of pausing that campaign. But both men were united in warning Israel’s Iranian-backed regional enemies from widening the war beyond the battlefields of Gaza. Yet northern Israel has seen a sharp escalation in violence with Lebanon this week. A rocket attack on the border town of K.S last night set cars and buildings ablaze. Hamas militants, who have a presence in Hezbollah-controlled areas of Lebanon, claimed responsibility for the barrage.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 11.02.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.02.23/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Nov 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.02.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The breakthrough in the desperate effort to evacuate Americans out of Gaza. At least seventy-four Americans fleeing today making their way out of the war zone and into safety in Egypt. The breakthrough comes with a major new battle underway tonight in northern Gaza. The Israeli army launching heavy attacks from land, sea and air. Prime Minister N saying “We are at the height of the battle”. Israel military is facing off with Hamas militants in close-combat battles as they advance deeper into Gaza City. And for the third day in a row, Israeli air strikes hit the Jabalia refugee camp as it targets members of Hamas. More than one hundred trucks with aid made their way into Gaza today, that’s a big number, as the humanitarian crisis there worsens. Secretary of State A.B is on his way to Israel, where the White House says he will urge leaders for a pause in the fighting to allow aid to be distributed and for the possible release of hostages. And there is breaking news. The House passed a fourteen-billion-dollar aid package for Israel, but without funding for Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Israel Defense Forces says face-to-face fighting is underway between Israeli soldiers and Hamas militants as troops push deeper into densely populated Gaza City. While further south, there is a desperate rush for those trying to escape the war zone. By the thousands they gathered at the gate today, daring to hope this time they’d make it out of Gaza. Back in the embattled strip of land, they managed to flee. Israeli airstrikes pounded the area around the Jabalia refugee camp, north of Gaza City, for the third day in a row. They even hit the school, cries a young woman, referring to an UN-run school where displaced residents had sought shelter. But being a school providing no more protection than the concrete pillars that collapsed around them. The UN said today four of their schools-turned-shelters were hit in the last twenty-four hours. Israeli Defense Forces released new video as the top commander claimed forces are encircling Gaza City on three sides. But even as they clear the battlefield of Hamas militants overground, dangers still lurk below. What first began two decades ago as a labyrinth of tunnels to move smuggled goods around has since become an advanced underground network known as the Gaza metro, housing command centers and weapons storage. Hamas released this new video set to show one of its militants emerging from a tunnel and planting explosives on an Israeli tank. The sky over Gaza lit up tonight in another series of airstrikes. Clouds of thick smoke rising as explosions ring out in the distance. A renewed bombardment from the air, even as Israeli troops fight it out on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 11.01.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.01.23/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Nov 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.01.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with the rush to escape Gaza for hundreds of foreign nationals, including American citizens who have been trapped in the war zone for more than three weeks. Today, the border crossing with Egypt was opened for the first time since the start of the war allowing hundreds of foreign passport holders and some critically injured Palestinians to leave Gaza. Diplomatic sources tell CBSN that this first batch of evacuations was negotiated by Qatar in coordination with the US. The news comes as the war between Israel and Hamas escalates, with a second air strike on the Jabalia refugee camp in as many days. Israel says fighter jets hit a terrorist command-and-control center and killed several members of Hamas. The UN Human Rights Office says the strikes on Tuesday could amount to war crimes due to the high numbers of civilian casualties. All this as Israeli ground forces push deeper into Palestinian territory. An Israeli Defense Forces commander says troops have broken through Hamas’s front lines and are now at the gates of Gaza City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, President B said we’ll see more from those negotiations in the coming days and the US government is working nonstop to get Americans out of Gaza as soon and as safely as possible. For fortunate few, the nightmare of living under the constant fear of bombardment is over today. Five hundred people mostly foreign passport holders, the first to cross from Gaza into Egypt since the conflict began, but only a handful of Americans so far. The US State Department says around four hundred US citizens still trying to get out of Gaza but more Americans are expected to leave tomorrow, plus their families.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 10.31.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.31.23/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Nov 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.31.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with Israeli’s invasion of Gaza growing more intense, with troops and tanks advanced further to enemy territory. This as the FBI Director, C.W, warned senators on Capitol Hill that the war could inspire extremist groups to launch attacks here in the US. Israeli forces are engaged in urban combat with Hamas fighters as they advance toward the densely populated center of Gaza City. Two Israeli soldiers were killed, the first since the ground incursion. Israel says it hit about three hundred Hamas targets with airstrikes in the last twenty-four hours, including at the Jabalia refugee camp in Gaza, causing catastrophic damage. Several apartment buildings were destroyed, killing dozens of people. And we learned today that the US is sending three hundred more US troops to the Middle East. They won’t go into Israel, but they will help with things like communications, disposal of explosives, and other support. And back here in Washington, protesters calling for a ceasefire disrupted, Secretary of State A.B’s testimony on Capitol Hill. Senators today confirmed former Treasury Secretary, J.L, as the new US ambassador to Israel. That’s actually a position that has been vacant for more than three months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight, fierce fighting is underway inside Gaza. Hamas has fired a barrage of rockets into Israel, several aiming there at Tel Aviv throughout the day, while rescue teams tonight are racing to find survivors in the latest series of Israeli airstrikes. The vast craters left behind as deep as they are wide, the sheer destruction surrounding residential buildings, the terrible human toll are all evidence of the ferocity of the Israeli airstrike north of Gaza City, right in the middle of the densely packed refugee camp. One survivor said felt like an earthquake. Hamas said dozens were killed with another a hundred and fifty badly wounded, making it one of the deadliest single attacks since fighting began. Israel Defense Forces released more video today, said to show its troops advancing through a desert scrubland, bulldozers paving a way through the sand and debris for tanks, and soldiers on patrol walking their way through the remains bombed out buildings after weeks of airstrikes.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 10.30.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.30.23/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Oct 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.30.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, the war between Israel and Hamas is escalating, with Israeli troops, tanks, and helicopters pushing deeper into Gaza. Prime Minister B.N tonight saying it is time for war and there will be no cease fire because doing so would be like surrendering to Hamas. Israel’s military has reached Gaza City. And there are reports that they’ve cut off a key road that connects the territory. The military says a female soldier who’s been held hostage since the October 7th attack was freed and is doing well. The near constant barrage of airstrikes continues, with Israel saying it hit hundreds of targets in the past twenty-four hours killing dozens of Hamas fighters. The Hamas run Gaza Health Ministry says the number of people killed there now tops eight thousand. The United Nation is warning that the worsening humanitarian situation is resulting in the breakdown of civil order with civilians ransacking relief centers. The prime minister’s address tonight was in English, clearly aimed at a global audience. He said the US would not agree to a cease fire after Pearl Harbor or 9/11. Neither should Israel. Israeli Defense Forces releasing new video set to show its tanks and troops pushing deeper into Gaza, saying they struck six hundred terror targets in the past twenty-four hours and also announcing that an Israeli soldier held hostage in Gaza is back home.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 10.29.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.29.23/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Oct 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.29.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Several big stories this Sunday including the sad news that Friends star M.P died this weekend. He was fifty-four. Tonight, P is being remembered for his role in one of TV&amp;rsquo;s biggest hits as well as his public struggle with addiction. But first, we begin with the latest in the Israel-Hamas war. Tonight, Egypt sent nearly three dozen trucks of food and medical aid into southern Gaza. Rockets fired by Hezbollah, militants in Lebanon hit a neiborhood in northern Israel. No word yet on casualties. This as fighting in the Gaza Strip expands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight, Israeli forces are on the attack and on the move inside Gaza saying more troops have entered the territory, while the humanitarian crisis inside Gaza is worsening by the minutes. The Israeli Defense Forces said they struck more than four hundred and fifty Hamas targets in a twenty-four period releasing new nighttime video claiming to show Israeli tanks advancing inside Gaza, flanked by infantry soldiers on foot, taking up positions under the cover of darkness and smoke screens. Hamas has reported firefights and released video purporting to show a missile attack on an Israeli troop carrier while aid agencies describe the toll on civilians as a catastrophic crisis. The UN has warned of a breakdown of civil order saying hundreds of people have stormed their warehouses in a desperate search for food and basic supplies. Large parts of the territory have been cut off from communications, but CBSN producer M.AG managed to report today scenes of despair and utter desolation.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 10.28.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.28.23/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Oct 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.28.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, Israeli Prime Minister B.N said that the second phase of Israel’s war against Hamas has begun. He did not describe it as an invasion. At a news conference, N repeated his pledge to destroy Hamas and returned hostages who were abducted three weeks ago. Today, Israel’s military said its ground forces remain fighting inside Gaza, after an intensive wave of airstrikes targeting Hamas leadership and tunnels. Internet and phones service is down throughout most of the territory, effectively cutting off Gaza from the world. That’s compounding the humanitarian crisis there and fueling outrage over rising civilians’ deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaza is in absolute chaos, and Israel’s strikes are only increasing in intensity. Israel Defense Forces said they have killed Hamas’ heads of both its Navy and its Air Force. This is now Israel’s second night of its bombardment of Gaza less than a mile away. Plumes billowed over Gaza today, ominous signs that the lives of two million people have become hell on Earth. Israel Defense Forces waging after their first pummeling of the strip in memory after fireballs Friday night lit up the skies in this new phase of the war. The military Friday lit up the skies in this new phase of the war. The military Friday said fighter jets struck one hundred fifty targets underground, while columns of Israeli tanks attacked from inside Palestinian territory.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 10.27.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.27.23/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Oct 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.27.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with a major escalation in Israel and Hamas was and what may turn out to be the next phase in a long and grueling battle. Two US officials telling CBSN that Israel appears to be begun a rolling start to its long-anticipated ground invasion of Gaza. Israel Defense Forces are saying that its ground operation in Gaza is expanding with new targeted attacks on Hamas infrastructure and its underground tunnel network. Tonight Palestinians are facing a near total blackout of phone and internet services following an unprecedented barrage of new airstrikes. The US is expressing concern about what this means for the more than two hundred hostages still being held by Hamas with negotiations apparently still ongoing. Jordan’s foreign minister warned that Israel’s ground war on the Gaza Strip will result in “a humanitarian catastrophe of epic proportions”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re just less than a mile from the border with Gaza and there have been explosions here pretty much all night. The constant sound of jets and drones explosions off in the distance. Even after weeks of airstrikes, what happened tonight and continues to happen is on another level. Israeli tanks have crossed into Gaza. Hamas says they’re fighting on two locations, as you said. In terms of scale, US officials tell CBSN this appears to be a rolling start to ground offensive. The skyline over Gaza City lit up in the most ferocious and sustained bombardment the territory has seen since the Israeli military unleashed its aerial assault on Hamas militants nearly three weeks ago. Whether the series of powerful explosions was the precursor to the major ground invasion, the Israeli Defense Forces only say ground operations were expanding tonight, warning residents of Gaza City to seek safer conditions that the IDF would persist in its attacks on the city and surrounding areas. This is said to show the impact of the bombardment from inside Gaza itself tonight. Telecom firms reported that the internet and cell phone services were cut off across the Palestinian territory. Today’s heavy bombardment follows two nights of raids as Israeli troops went on the offensive by land and sea. The IDF released this video set to show a naval commando unit conducting a raid on what it called a Hamas terrorist infrastructure, apparently reaching the shore at one point and engaging in ferocious firefights. That coincided with another nighttime ground attack. This video claiming to show Israeli tanks rolling across the border, artillery and aircraft striking anti-tank missile launchers and operational headquarters. The full force of Israeli airstrikes dropping whole city blocks, one of two hundred and fifty targets the IDF say they attacked claiming their aim is the destruction of terrorist units.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 10.26.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.26.23/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Oct 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.26.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, we’re in Lewiston, Maine, the scene of five hundred sixty fifth mass shooting in the US this year. With the FBI surrounded a home linked to the suspect in his hometown of Bowdoin. Police say they were executing a search warrant at the residence. Eighteen people were killed and more than a dozen others injured after a gunman opened fire inside a bowling alley and then in a nearby bar. Tonight, the suspect remained unknown, with the FBI joining state police in a search for forty-year-old R.C, who is considered armed and dangerous. Authorities are asking for help from the public in tracking down the Army reservist, who was hospitalized this summer for mental health issues including hearing voices. Tonight, heavily armed police surrounding a home in Bowdoin, Maine, as they search for the suspect behind the deadly mass shooting. Police on megaphone heard yelling “come out with your hands in the air”. It’s not clear who was inside the home, twenty four hours after last night’s massacre. Gunfire rang out shortly before 7 P.M. at Just-In-Time Recreation bowling alley, the first of two shooting scenes in Lewiston, Maine. Seven people were killed. Minutes later, at 7:08 P.M. frantic 911 calls began streaming in, with reports of an active shooter at Schemengees Bar and Grille, four miles away. Eight people there were found dead. More than a dozen people were injured in both shootings. Three victims later died at the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 10.25.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.25.23/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Oct 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.25.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, the world is waiting and watching for a ground invasion in Gaza. In a nationally televised address tonight, Israeli Prime Minister B.N warns Hamas is doomed and that his military is getting prepared and that his government is working around the clock until reaches victory. But there’s no word on what that means. It comes as Gaza’s health system is on the brink of collapse. The World Health Organization says roughly a third of the territory’s hospitals are offline and not functioning as a result of air strikes and the lack of supplies like fuel and medicine. But we begin right here in Washington with a major breakthrough in the House of Representatives. After three weeks of chaos and dysfunction among Republicans, the GOP finally came together to elect a new speaker of the House. Conservative M.J of Louisianna got the required two hundred and seventeen votes to take the gavel. That is something three other nominees failed to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaker J defied the odds. Coming into this race, he was relatively unknown. Now he has been catapulted to second in line the presidency. Winning unanimously on the first ballot, Louisiana Congressman M.J claimed what had become a very elusive speaker’s gavel after three weeks of stalled business without a permanent leader. The fifty-one-year-old J is an evangelical Christian, former conservative radio talk show host, and in just his fourth term in Congress, the least experienced speaker in decades. But he managed to unite both the hard-right and establishment flanks of the party who fought bitterly over who should lead. Democrats railed against J, a staunch ally of former President T who helped lead a congressional push to overturn the 2020 election results. Representing Northwest Louisiana, J has taken a sharp stance against gay right and supports a nationwide abortion ban without exceptions. Florida Republican M.G, who led the effort to remove K.M as a speaker said the hardliners won.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 10.24.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.24.23/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Oct 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.24.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, the humanitarian crisis is deepening inside Gaza with President B saying efforts to bring aid to civilians are not moving fast enough. Just today, eight trucks carrying food, water, and medicine were allowed across the border, the first in twenty-four hours but it is not nearly enough to meet demand. Hundreds of thousands of Israeli troops are positioned along the border ahead of an anticipated ground invasion that appears to be on hold for the moment in order to buy time for hostage negotiations. Israel has increased the barrage of airstrikes with Hamas-run Gaza health ministry saying it suffered its single deadliest day of the war. Secretary of State A.B today warned Iran that the US would respond if they or their proxies use the conflict to attack Americans, this as the Pentagon announced that Iranian-backed militias have targeted US troops in the Middle-East at least thirteen times in the past week with rockets and drone attacks. And we learned just short time ago, at least two dozen US service members were hurt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite an increase in the number of attacks on both sides of this fight today, another humanitarian convoy has rolled into Gaza, the Palestinian Red Crescent announcing that they’ve received another eight trucks of aids but no fuel while concerns grows for civilians and hostages alike. Y.L and N.C only landed here in Tel-Aviv from Egypt in the early hours, yet this morning, a smiling eighty-five-year-old L was ready to share her story saying “I went through hell” describing how Hamas kidnappers draped her over a motorcycle. She said militants took away her watch and jewelry as she was led down a vast network of tunnels she said looked like a spider web.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 10.23.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.23.23/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Oct 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.23.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, two Israeli hostages are freed, released by Hamas as the war in Middle East intensifies. The women crossed into Egypt with the help of the Qatari government and international red cross and then reportedly taken by helicopter to Israel. They were kidnapped from their homes along with their husbands, who are still held captive by Hamas. The war now entering its third week and Israel launched one of its heaviest barrages of airstrikes today hitting three hundred and twenty targets in Gaza in the last twenty-four hours. And tonight, former President O putting out a lengthy statement, affirming Israel’s right to self defense but also warning “any Israeli military strategy that ignores the human costs could ultimately backfired.” But we want to begin with terrifying situation here at home in the skies. And off-duty Alaska airlines pilot is facing charges of attempted murder after allegedly trying to shut down the plane’s engines. The flight from Everrett, Washington to San Francisco landed safely in Portland, Oregon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was about thirty minutes after Alaska Airlines flight 2059 took off with eighty-four people on board, including infants riding in their parent’s laps. Police say forty-four-year-old J.E, an off-duty Alaska pilot riding in the cockpit jump seat, allegedly attempted to turn off plane’s engines at about thirty-one thousand feet. There are reports he may have tried to pull these red engine fire suppression handles. E. was handcuffed in the back of the plane as pilots made an emergency landing in Portland. There were no injuries. CBSN obtained this alert FAA sent to airlines about the incidents, noting it is not connected in anyway shape, or form to current world events and law enforcement sources say there does not appear to be a connection to terrorism. E is a married father of two in the bay area who is seen visiting sick kids in the hospital in photos posted into Facebook. Tonight, the FBI and local police are still investigating, but so far, no clear motive. E is behind bars expected in court tomorrow afternoon to face those one hundred sixty seven criminal charges.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 10.22.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.22.23/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Oct 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.22.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin once again tonight in the Middle East. For days now, an Israeli ground invasion in Gaza has appeared imminent following Hamas’s deadly rampage two weeks ago. Today Israeli warplanes took aim across the Palestinian territory. Targets in the occupied West Bank and Syria were also hit as the war with Hamas threatens to spiraled into a wider conflict. In Iran, the country’s foreign minister called the region “a powder keg”. In a major change, the USS Eisenhower, with its accompanying warships and fighter jets was redirected to the Persian Gulf in response to the rising tensions in the region. Also today, fourteen trucks carrying goods and medical supplies entered Gaza from Egypt. They are the second convoy of aid to arrive since Israel imposed a complete seizure of the territory. And in Delaware, President spent times outdoors today after speaking to Israel’s Prime Minister B.N and six other world leaders. Mr. B also spoke about conflict and peace with Pope Francis. But tonight, it’s desperation and war that dominates our coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Israeli Defense Forces have vowed to intensify their attacks on Gaza with the aim of crippling Hamas’s fighting abilities ahead of that expected ground offensive. But civilians continue to pay the heaviest price. Tonight, Israel is stepping up its aerial assault again, escalating air strikes even further in the last twenty hours pummeling Gaza as the death toll climbs to more than forty-three hundred people. On a second front, the West Bank, a rare air strike there in the city of Jenin targeting a suspected terror cell Israeli military officials describe as a ticking bomb. A second aid convoy rolled into Gaza from Egypt, carrying desperately needed food, water and medicine. Gaza’s overwhelmed hospitals are not only operating without power, but adequate equipment and supplies.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 10.21.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.21.23/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Oct 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.21.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, Gaza on the brink of an invasion. Two weeks after a deadly surprise attack by Hamas, Israel stands ready to send in troops on the ground. Soldiers and tanks are amassed along the border, waiting for word to strike. The Israeli military says ahead of the ground offensive, it is intensifying air attacks, which already have been pounding Gaza since the start of the war. In Egypt, Arab leaders met today to call for a ceasefire fire and peace summit to end this brutal conflict. Thousands are dead on both sides. Among the victims in Gaza, at least sixteen UN workers and nearly two dozen journalists. The brutality of this war has spawned protests around the world. Today in London, tens of thousands marched in support of the Palestinian cause. Meanwhile today, Egypt briefly allowed just twenty trucks into Gaza carrying food, medicine, and water but no fuel was allowed. The UN is hoping a second convoy of relief trucks will be allowed in on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Civilians in Gaza have been paying the price since Hamas’s barbaric attack on Israeli civilians. More than half a million people survived on UN aid cut off food, water and medical supplies to the fury of Palestinians, including US passport holders like L.B, who feels abandoned by President B. Speaking to CBSN, she and her family are at the border with Egypt, where after two weeks of an Israeli blockade, aid is finally coming in, but at a trickle. Only twenty trucks for now compared to the hundreds that entered daily before the latest conflict. In response to the bloodshed, the Arab world has been ablaze in protest, demonstrators denouncing Israel and America for supporting it with billions in military aid. The rage even in Cairo, the city notorious for the 2011 mass protests of Tahir Square, the epicenter of the Arab Spring followed by a brutal police crackdown. For the past decade, demonstrations in Egypt have been banned. Now, they’re encouraged. Fury over the innocent deaths of Palestinians, and fear of a mass influx of refugees into Egypt, where security forces could be overwhelmed by a human stampede, says former Egyptian lawmaker and Israel expert, E.G.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 10.20.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.20.23/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Oct 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.20.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin with breaking news out of Israel. We’re learning new details about the two American hostages who are free tonight after being held captive by Hamas for nearly two weeks in Gaza. This is the first photo of a mother and her teenage daughter taking just moments after they cross the border into Israel and into safety. N.R and her mother J, who are from Chicago area, were in Israel to celebrate a family member’s eighty fifth birthday. The seventeen-year-old’s father tonight telling CBSN his daughter is doing ok. This picture just released shows President B speaking on the phone with them saying they have the full support of the US government as they recover from the unimaginable. There are still about two hundred hostages from forty countries being held in Gaza. And tonight, the border crossing with Egypt remains closed despite an agreement to allow much needed humanitarian aid into the region. The Secretary of State saying he expects “see that moving soon”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Israeli spokesman said tonight the two women are safely in the hands of Israeli troops. Personnel from the Red Cross helped escort them from Gaza into Israel. Relatives of their captives here welcomed the release, appealing for more hostages to be freed. J.R and her seventeen-year-old daughter N had come to Israel to celebrate the eighty-fifth birthday of J’s mother. Israeli officials say they were kidnapped by Hamas gunmen from the Nahal Oz kibbutz not more than a few hundred yards away from Gaza during the militant group’s murderous rampage October 7th. The breakthrough came tonight when Hamas announced it was releasing the two Americans on humanitarian grounds following negotiations through Qatari mediators. Later confirmed by the Israeli Defense Forces spokesman saying, they are within the territory of Israel and in the arms of the army. US officials say the small number of Americans scattered and hidden away amid catastrophic destruction and violent chaos in Gaza. Today, a symbolic ceremony was held by family members in Tel-Aviv. Two hundred and three seats at a Chabot dinner their loved ones may never join.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 10.19.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.19.23/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Oct 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.19.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, President B just delivered his second Oval Office address of his presidency, a setting that underscores the seriousness of the message. The situation in the Middle East is deteriorating. Israeli airstrikes intensifying after the President’s visit to Tel-Aviv, with bombings across the Gaza strip. And protests erupting across the Middle East with multiple Arab leaders calling for demonstrations tomorrow, even as we learn new details about the Gaza explosion. Israeli Defense Forces now saying the blast happened outside of the hospital and Western intelligence indicates Israel had nothing to do with the blast. Today, a US Navy destroyer, living up to its name, firing the first American shots of this conflict, taking down drones and missiles coming from Yemen. Also, this new, tonight, an official telling CBSN the US is preparing to send two Iron Dome missile defense systems to Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tensions escalating by the minute across this region tonight from area demonstrations to fighting on three fronts while the Israeli defense minister tells troops here, you’ll soon see Gaza from the inside. The Israeli military resumed its ferocious bombardments of Gaza after the briefest of breaks during President B’s visit here yesterday. Gaza’s health ministry said the death toll has soared to nearly four thousand, if it hasn’t topped that already, as they count the bodies recovered by the moment. Hundreds of thousands of people have fled to escape the aerial onslaught and find food and shelter ahead of Israel’s anticipated ground offensive. Trucks carrying aid, lined up in a traffic jam on Egypt side of the border with Gaza, may be ready to roll after an UN-brokered deal to allow twenty trucks to cross into Gaza. But international aid agency said that doesn’t come close to meeting the needs of more than one million people displaced within Gaza, nearly half the territory’s population. Across, to the other Palestinian territory of the West Bank. Israeli army video appears to show a rare Israeli drone strike on a suspected Palestinian gunman following clashes there. Turning north of the country, another flashpoint. Israeli tanks opened fire toward Lebanon after Iranian backed Hezbollah fired at least twenty rockets and anti-tank missile into Israeli territory. In Egypt, the president calling for a rare day of protest, adding to pro-Palestinian demonstrations across the region, in anticipation of Israel’s expected move on Gaza. Jihadist leaders calling for able-bodied men to make their way towards Israel, like those boarding buses in Iraq. Others calling for attacks on all US bases in the region. Near the Gaza border, Prime Minister B.N rallying forces.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 10.18.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.18.23/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Oct 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.18.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, President B is on his way back to the US after historic visit to an active war zone. The trip, a dramatic show of support for Israel and his push for humanitarian aid to be allowed to enter Gaza appears to have had some success. And new tonight, the White House just announcing that President B will address the nation tomorrow at 8 P.M. Eastern time in an Oval Office speech. Tensions are rising in the Middle East after that deadly hospital’s explosion in Gaza. US Senators just getting out of an intelligence briefing. The B administration telling them it has high confidence that Israel was not responsible and that a misfired rocket from a terror group inside Gaza led to the blast. Now, that assessment is based on intercepts and satellite images. But all that data has little to tamp down the anger sweeping across the region. Many still blaming Israel for the carnage. Back here at home, this scene on Capitol Hill, where around three hundred protesters demanding a cease fire were arrested. And there is new warning tonight that terrorist groups like Hezbollah and an al-Qaeda affiliate are calling for attacks against the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President B was only on the ground for about seven hours, and there was actually a lull in fighting. It was an extraordinary show of support for the people here and amid massive and growing anger for the explosion that took place at that hospital in Gaza. It wasn’t long after President B touched down in Tel-Aviv to the embrace of a prime minister at war that he addressed the hospital explosion that has left hundreds of people dead. The other team, meaning Palestinian militants citing US intelligence. US officials tell CBSN that includes communication intercepts and satellite images, giving high confidence Israeli forces were not responsible. That supports intelligence from Israeli Defense Forces saying this independently shot video shows that rocket comes up and down, fired by a nearby cemetery landing on hospital grounds releasing what they say is an audio intercept, implicating Islamic Jihad militants in the launch. Daytime images of the aftermath show extensive explosion damage in the parking lot not necessarily a direct hit to the hospital. Hamas still insist Israeli airstrike is to blame. The president’s visit is much a pledge of solidarity as a message to Israeli’s neighbors. At the same time, he urged restraint over retaliation, persuading the Israeli Prime Minister to allow basic humanitarian aid to deliver to southern Gaza from Egypt, desperately needed food, water and medicine. Even as the two men spoke, not far away, heavily armed bulldozers were getting in position to plow into Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 10.17.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.17.23/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Oct 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.17.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with the breaking news that is reverberating around the world. When President B announced his trip to the Middle East, there was hope that his meetings with Israeli and Arab leaders could result in relief to Gaza and the release of American hostages. Tonight, that hope has faded. We’re learning new details tonight about an explosion at a hospital in Gaza City. A Palestinian health ministry saying hundreds of people were killed and many more injured. Take a look at some of these images. Women and children in the aftermath waiting for treatment, terrified. The hospital just hit and overwhelmed. Now, Hamas is blaming an Israeli airstrike but Israel is denying responsibility saying their intelligence shows it was caused by a failed rocket launch by the group Islamic Jihad. Throughout this conflict, civilians have taken refuge around hospitals and schools in hopes of avoiding the near-constant airstrikes from above. And tonight, that safety shattered. It was just President B was boarding Air Force One this afternoon that he learned his meetings in Jordan canceled. And we’re now learning he won’t travel to Jordan at all but will still go to Tel-Aviv as a show of support for Israel, a city where air-raid sirens continue to go off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re still getting new details about exactly what happened at that hospital in Gaza. As you mentioned, Israeli Defense Forces specifically naming Islamic Jihad. This is another Islamic militant organization that shares Gaza with Hamas also at war with Israel launching attacks here, just adding to the volatility. Cellphone footage captured the moment in an explosion turned an overcrowded hospital in Gaza into a massive fireball. Hundreds are thought to have been killed in what might be Gaza’s worst single loss of life yet. Prime Minister B.N said tonight an analysis shows the explosion was caused by a barrage of rockets that misfired by Palestinian militants Islamic Jihad within Gaza. Hamas blamed Israel saying the strike is a result of what they called unlimited US support for Israel. It triggered international condemnation, Egypt, Qatar, Iran, Jordan, and Turkey among the countries who have denounced the airstrike. Palestinian President M.A who was meeting with the US Secretary of State A.B in the Jordanian capital, has declared three days of mourning in response to the hospital strike. Protests have erupted in the West Bank and in Jordan where security forces used tear gas to disperse crowds of protesters trying to storm Israeli embassy. The hospital disaster has only heaped more misery and bloodshed on Gaza where horrific scenes after a series of Israeli airstrikes have taken the level of sheer human suffering and soaring death toll to next level. In Raffa, terrified children cried out as frantic residents scrambled among the rubble in search for survivors. Some children, unable to make any sound at all.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 10.16.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.16.23/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Oct 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.16.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, we learned that Hamas took even more hostages that we knew. And the race is on to find nearly two hundred people before an Israeli ground invasion. And world leaders are working to get aid in and foreigners out of Gaza as conditions worsen. Much of Gaza is already in ruins. And the humanitarian crisis is getting worse by the hour. And there is breaking news as Israeli Defense forces say it killed the head of Hamas general intelligence. Secretary of State A.B back in Tel-Aviv today to push for more diplomatic effort to address this ongoing crisis including efforts to open a civilian and humanitarian corridor from Gaza to Egypt. As of tonight, the border of Egypt is still closed to thousands who are trying to flee the war zone. The number of killed continues to rise with more than fourteen hundred in Israel and nearly three thousand in Gaza. And more American troops are on standby tonight preparing to be possibly deployed to the region. In an interview with Sixty Minutes, President B endorsed Israel’s goal of destroying Hamas but also warned Israel not to try to reoccupy Gaza saying it would be “a big mistake”. CBSN has learned the President is considering a trip to Israel this week in a show of support. The evacuations of Americans from Israel are underway tonight, nearly a thousand leaving by air and even by sea using cruise ships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As tens of thousands flee from the northern Gaza, we’ve learned the Israel military has bombed the largest city in the south with hundreds of strikes. Nowhere in Gaza, it seems is safe tonight. Israel’s furious strikes on Gaza are laying waste to entire neighborhoods. The northern Jabalia refugee camp is now a hellscape after Israeli airstrikes demolished over thirty seven hundred residential buildings across the Palestinian territory. The few who remain gathered what has left of their broken lives. Israel’s evacuation orders of Gaza’s northern half have triggered an urgent exodus. The UN says more than a million Palestinians have fled their homes, nearly half of the strip’s entire population since the Hamas attack as the death toll rapidly approaches three thousand. Many of those who fled from the North are coming here to the Southern Rafah border crossing with Egypt, the only way out of Gaza. But the crossing remains closed after it was damaged by repeated Israeli airstrikes and because Egyptian restrictions leaving foreign passport holders including as many as six hundred Americans, trapped in Gaza. Hundreds of tons of desperately needed aid from several countries also remain stuck on Egyptian side. Secretary of State A.B who back to Israel to meet with Prime Minister B.N after crisscrossing the Middle East where he met with several Arab leaders to prevent a humanitarian crisis in Gaza from plunging even further after Israel blocked food, water, medical supplies and fuel from entering Palestinian territory. The UN is now warning Gaza’s hospital which are powered entirely by generators will be out of gas within twenty four hours as doctors warn hundreds of patients who desperately need surgery are being left untreated.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 10.15.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.15.23/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Oct 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.15.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Israel is mobilized right now for war as the country prepares to launch a ground invasion into Hamas-controlled Gaza. Border clashes are intensifying. Aerial bombardments of the territory devastating. You can see there hundreds of thousands of Palestinians with no where to go. Tonight, Secretary of State A.B is in Jordan wrapping meetings with Arab leaders in six nations. He returns to Israel in just a few hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Israeli Prime Minister B.N convened an emergency cabinet for the first time today vowing to demolish Hamas while Israeli military said they are ready and waiting for the order to launch the invasion. Under bombardment and under siege ahead of looming ground offensive, Gaza is already edging ever closer humanitarian catastrophe. Authorities say more than two thousand four hundred people killed, a quarter of them children. Nearly ten thousand wounded. A situation so grim they’re using ice cream trucks as makeshift morgues. Hundreds of thousands of residents fleeing south as the Israeli military ordered them to evacuate from the north. The World Health Organization called the forced evacuation of twenty-two hospitals tantamount to a death sentence with babies on incubators and those in intensive care. Israel announcing today it was resuming water supplies to Southern Gaza after shutting down to the entire territory earlier this week. Fighting has broken out in the north too. Israeli forces shelling southern Lebanon after the militant group Hezbollah fired rockets into Israel. Near to Gaza, Israeli armor has been massing. Along what has now become a militarized zone lies the Kfar Aza Kibbutz, the site of a massacre against Israeli civilians. The sheer destruction and bodies of Hamas gunman tell the horrors that unfolded when the terrorist group descended on this small farming community.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 10.14.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.14.23/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Oct 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.14.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;One week after Israel suffered a deadly surprise attack by Hamas militant from Gaza. The sealed off territory is in turmoil. Tonight, many Palestinians are trying to flee from the north after Israel ordered them to evacuate and as bombardment from the air intensify ahead of an expected ground invasion. Israeli Prime Minister B.N says the next stage is coming and the sweeping attack is planned. But Gaza is already being hit. This video showing the moment Israeli air strike on emergency workers responding to earlier attack. In United Arab Emirates, Secretary of State A.B underscore US support for Israel self-defense but said care should be taken to protect civilians.
One week since Hamas launched attack on Israeli civilians. The war rages on tonight. Gaza bearing the brunt of Israeli firepower with the death toll climbing by the hour. The military wing of Hamas released this video purported to show its long-range missiles targeting Tel-Aviv. But it’s Gaza under receiving a punishing and relentless Israeli bombardment. The UN says nearly one million people have been displaced close to half of the tiny, packed population. Tens of thousands of Gazans fleeing from North to South. Leaflets of warnings from Israeli military to evacuate that region ahead of an expected ground defense. For some, this proved fatal. A strike here on a supposed safe route killed twelve people. Tonight, Israeli defense forces issued this statement saying troops are preparing to implement a wide range of operational offensive plans, an indication of Gaza may be imminent.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 10.13.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.13.23/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Oct 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.13.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The big headline today is the evacuation order of more than one million Palestinians from northern Gaza raising concerns of a worsening humanitarian disaster. Israeli planes dropped thousands of leaflets warnings residents to leave the area immediately. A pending ground invasion of Gaza appears imminent. The UN says moving almost half the population would result in “devastating humanitarian consequences”. The Israeli military also began conducting targeted raids inside Gaza to hunt down Hamas militants and search for the hostages. At the White House, President B spoke with the families of fourteen Americans who are still unaccounted for following last Saturday’s attacks. And the State Department says the first charter flight to evacuate American citizens from here in Israel has landed in Greece. The number of people killed continues to rise with more than thirteen hundred in Israel, and over nineteen hundred in Gaza, including six hundred children. And today, Reuters videographer I.A was killed and six others injured by Israeli shelling across border in Lebanon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Israel’s massive airstrikes are continuing tonight as Palestinian families desperately run for cover and there’s no way of knowing how many evacuated from their homes in northern Gaza. Carrying whatever they can, Palestinians flee their homes in Northern Gaza on foot following Israel’s border by leaflets for more than one million people who live there to evacuate. A massive evacuation the UN says is impossible. According to Hamas, seventy people, mostly women and children were killed in an Israeli airstrike that hit a convoy fleeing Gaza city. Since Hamas’ deadly rampage across southern Israel, Israeli military has carried out thousands of strikes across the Palestinian territory, inflicting mass casualties and pushing the already ailing health care system to the brink as doctors struggle to treat so many wounded. Israel is now blockading food, fuel, and water causing even more misery.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 10.12.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.12.23/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Oct 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.12.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The main headlines here is Israel’s bid to crush Hamas with near-constant barrage of airstrikes on Gaza ahead of its expected ground invasion in the coming days. The catastrophic damage in Gaza is leading to humanitarian crisis. The United Nations now warning that food and water are quickly running out for the more than two million Palestinians who are trapped there. More than twelve hundred have been killed in Israel, over fifteen hundred in Gaza. The number of American killed is now at twenty-seven and there are fourteen Americans still missing. And the horrors of war keep getting worse. Six straight days of air assaults. The Israeli military dropping six thousand bombs since they began their counterstrike on Gaza. While troops on the ground ready to for an invasion any day, today, the US showing its support, with Secretary of State A.B in Tel-Aviv. The Secretary telling us the State Department is now arranging flights to evacuate Americans out of Israel. The death toll rising, the grim task of recovering bodies continues. After Israeli intelligence failed to thwart the attack.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 10.11.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.11.23/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Oct 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.11.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The big headline here, as Israel prepares for a ground invasion and hundreds of thousands of its soldiers are on the border of Gaza, now there is a new emergency wartime government here, a unity government bringing together Prime Minister B.N and one of his main political rivals. Tonight, we are also learning more Americans are among the dead with even more missing, some believed to have kidnapped by Hamas. Hostage rescue teams, Delta Force and Seal Team Six remain in the United States, waiting for Israel to request assistance. A source telling CBSN that request would come as soon as today. President B spoke today with Prime Minister B.N for a fourth time since the attacks, telling him that despite all the anger, Israel needs to operate by the rules of war. Secretary of State A.B is on his way here as a sign of solidarity. Airstrikes are pummeling Gaza. That’s a near-constant bombardment. Israeli defense forces say it struck more than two thousand targets in the first days of this war. And what’s left is nothing but ruin. Look, you can see entire neighborhoods turned to rubble. Rockets continue to fall in Israel, even near the main airport here in Tel-Aviv today where people were forced to take cover inside the terminal. Israel is also paying close attention to the north with troops exchanging rocket fire with H forces over the border with Lebanon. More than twelve hundred people have been killed in Israel including nearly two hundred Israeli soldiers.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 10.10.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.10.23/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Oct 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.10.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We’re in Israel, as it prepares for an expected ground invasion of Gaza in what is already the bloodiest war in decades. Here, in Tel Aviv, we heard air-raid sirens throughout the day with constant threats of rocket attacks. On day four of this escalating war. Israel is pounding Gaza with hundreds of missile strikes, targeting what the military calls a Hamas terror nest. Reports tonight, the IDF took out Hamas’s economic minister. And more than one thousand people have been killed in Israel with an estimated nine hundred in Gaza. And we have learned some disturbing new details about a massacre that occurred in a small Israeli village near the Gaza border, with the brutal murders of men, women, and children, including babies. At least fourteen Americans are among the dead, with at least twenty more Americans unaccounted for. Some are being held hostage by Hamas. President B spoke today with Israeli Prime Minister. It has been their third phone call since this crisis began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hamas says it won’t hold any negotiations over the hostages that it’s holding while it is still under fire. And, as we now know, some of them are Americans. Israeli airstrikes are pounding the Gaza Strip, perhaps softening the territory for a ground invasion. Israel says it’s destroying weapon storage and infrastructure used by Hamas, which is designated a terrorist group by the US. Palestinian officials put the death toll at nine hundred. And the United Nations says there have been more than a dozen hits on health facilities. Israel’s military says it’s now positioned thirty-five battalions in the areas surrounding Gaza, from where Hamas launched attack on Saturday. It caught Israel’s security forces off guard but Hamas propaganda videos appear to show the militants training for a similar attack, complete with a model village. The militants fired more barrages and rockets today, hitting the city of Ashkelon in southern Israel. The country’s prime minister, B.N promised his people they would have vengeance. But the scale of what the militants inflicted on Israel is still emerging. In some small farming communities, people were murdered wherever the gunmen found them.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 10.09.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.09.23/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Oct 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.09.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight here in Tel Aviv following an unprecedented terror attack by Hamas militants and Israel’s declaration of war for the first time in fifty years. Israel’s military is bombarding Gaza with airstrikes raining down on Hamas, including command centers located inside apartment buildings. More than fifteen hundred people have been killed. Tonight, we are learning at least nine hundred Israelis dead. Tonight, Hamas claims they are holding at least one hundred people hostage, including an unknown number of Americans. At least eleven Americans are among the dead. We have also learned that one of the victims is D.M and we’re going to hear from her father in just a few moments. Israeli Prime Minister B.N addressing the nation saying today, Israel didn’t start this war, but will finish it. Tonight, the military is preparing for a likely ground invasion of Gaza with reports of fighting on Israeli’s northern border as well. That is significant. President B today declared his unwavering support for Israel and will speak tomorrow from the White House.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A senior defense official says the US is deeply concerned this could open up a second front. Now it’s not surprising that Hezbollah might want to get involved. It’s a militant group with deep ties to both Hamas and Iran, it’s also designated as a terrorist organization by the US.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 10.08.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.08.23/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Oct 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.08.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The rapidly intensifying conflict between Israel and Palestinian militants roared into a second day Sunday, with new fears the surprise attack could spark a wider Middle East war. Today, the Pentagon ordered US warships and forces in the region to move even closer to Israel including the aircraft carrier G.R.F, currently deployed in the Mediterranean. Israeli soldiers today battled Hamas militant at the country’s southern border. More than a thousand people have reportedly been killed on both sides. The White House confirming some are in fact American citizens. They include at least two hundred and sixty Israelis attending a music festival near the border. Hamas claims to hold more than one hundred people hostages right now. Israeli has responded of course with fury. Fighter jets taking aim at targets in the Palestinian territory. Here in New York, hundreds of Israelis and Palestinians supporters held rival rallies in Times Square. And at the US Capitol today, the flag was lowered to half-staff in solidarity with Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here in Israel, Prime Minister B.N says his country is now engaged in a, quote “long and difficult war.” Hamas gunmen smashed their way through barricades that Israel uses to contain Palestinian in Gaza. The militants, designated as terrorists by the US, fired waves of rockets into Israel and arrived by sea and even in paragliders. It was a complex and coordinated attack. What followed was a bloodletting. Civilians were slaughtered on the highways and in the towns of southern Israel. In Sderot, around 2 miles from the border with Gaza Strip. Hamas gunmen overran the police station, killing dozens. It’s now a charred ruin. Minutes after we arrived today, we heard gunfire and an Israeli SWAT team moved in. Later, the police told us there was no militant and an Israeli citizen had accidentally been shot and injured. Their nervousness isn’t surprising. Hamas also took hostages including women, children and the elderly. They paraded some of them through the streets of Gaza. Israel says among them are US citizens.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 10.07.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.07.23/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Oct 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.07.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Today, Israel battled to repel a surprise invasion of its territory after Palestinian militants launched highly-coordinated attacks from Gaza. Thousands of rockets were fired into Israel as gunman infiltrated several border towns and bases, kidnapping civilians and soldiers. Israel’s Prime Minister B.N declared the country was, quote, “at war”. He said their enemy would pay an unprecedented price. Israel warplane took aim at Gaza. Among the targets hit, this high rise which was reduced to rubble. Hundreds have been killed on both sides and it is a sharp escalation of violence for a region that bears the scars of centuries of conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight, a fresh wave of rockets has hit Tel-Aviv with the Israel military saying it’s saying in twenty-two locations as the government confirms over two hundred and fifty Israelis are now dead, at least sixteen hundred injured, and an unknown number remain in captivity. The question many Israelis are asking now is, how? How was Hamas able to carry out such a massive attack? Remember, Israel arguably has the most powerful and best-funded intelligence agencies in the Middle-East. It spends millions to secure its border fence with Gaza to prevent something like this from happening. And yet, Hamas fighters were able to carry out such a catastrophic attack. As for Hamas, what it’s calling operation Al-Aqsa Flood will not doubt see the death toll in Gaza spiral as Israel continues to retaliate. So far, at least one hundred and ninety eight Palestinians have been killed and over sixteen hundred wounded in the series of strikes according to the territory’s ministry of health, as armed Palestinian groups in the occupied West Bank have vowed tonight to join Hamas in its ongoing assault. And while the Israeli leadership is vowing to inflict, quote, “unprecedented price on Hamas”, this is uncharted territory for Israel, which now finds itself in a full-scale war.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 10.06.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.06.23/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Oct 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.06.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with the economy and a booming new government report showing the jobs market is stronger than expected. Businesses added three hundred and thirty-six thousand jobs last month nearly doubling expectations. The unemployment rate remained near a historic low of three-point eight percent. President B hailed the news crediting his economic policies for keeping the unemployment rate below four percent for twenty months in a row. That’s the longest stretch in fifty years. Wall Street liked what it was hearing, with the DOW jumping nearly three hundred points and the S&amp;amp;P rising more than one percent. While businesses are reporting record profits, some workers are not feeling the benefits with ongoing strikes calling for more pay and better job protections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This strong jobs report could lead the federal reserve to hike interest rates again next month to try to further curb inflation. That, of course, would make borrowing more expensive when it comes to cars and mortgages and credit cards. And these are all things that striking workers out here are telling us they already can’t afford it. It’s a tale of two economies. Strikers continue their walkouts nationwide as a strong September jobs reports shows the economy continues to grow. Three hundred thirty-six thousand jobs were added last month smashing economists’ expectations posting a thirty-three straight month of gains. July and August jobs were revised up, adding one hundred nineteen thousand more than previously reported. Four hundred and fifty-three thousand have walked off the job this year alone, including actors who’ve been on the picket lines for eighty-four days. It’s been three weeks now for striking autoworkers. Today, their union president announced they would not expand their strike as negotiations continue with the Big Three automakers. It’s a feeling shared among the seventy-five thousand striking Kaiser healthcare workers&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 10.05.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.05.23/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Oct 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.05.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with a major reversal by the B administration due to the ongoing crisis at the southern border. The administration is moving forward with plans to build new border barriers in South Texas. It’s an abrupt change from a campaign pledge made by then-candidate J.B. The president defended his decision saying he has no choice because the funding was approved specifically for a border wall. For just a second time in history, data from the Department of Homeland Security shows apprehensions along the southern border surpassed two million in the past year. Southern states are not alone in feeling the impact with Texas Governor G.A sending busloads of asylum-seekers to so-called sanctuary cities. Mayors from New York to Los Angeles say they are being overwhelmed by the massive influx of migrants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only is the B administration fast-tracking the construction of this wall. It’s also waiving twenty-six different laws and regulations to do something President B vowed never to do. Eighteen-foot-high steel panels will be installed along twenty miles stretched of the Rio Grande near McAllen, Texas. They are meant to stop scenes like this, hundreds of migrants who racing towards the US Border on Tuesday night. President B insisted today, he didn’t want to build the wall but that his hands were tied by a law Congress passed in 2019. But his own Homeland Security Secretary traveling in Mexico said they do work. Secretary M issued a notice stating there is presently an acute and immediate need to construct physical barriers in order to prevent unlawful entries into the United States. Immigration is a sensitive political issue for President B who made this campaign promise in 2020. But as illegal border crossings have surged, above two hundred thousand last months alone, even some of his political allies have grown critical. In Chicago, hundreds of migrants are sleeping on the sidewalks outside the police station. Illinois Governor JB.P wrote “the federal government’s lack of intervention and coordination at the border has created an untenable situation in Illinois.” New York City’s Democratic mayor has also been outspoken and issued this warning in Mexico today. Late this afternoon, the administration announced it will be restarting direct deportations of Venezuelan migrants back to their home country. Venezuelans accounted for nearly a quarter all illegal border crossings last month.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 10.04.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.04.23/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Oct 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.04.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;:::details Don&amp;rsquo;t waste ur time on this political drama&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with the political and real-world fallout from the historic removal of the Speaker of the House. The unprecedented vote to vacate the chair leaves the House of Representatives in a state of chaos and at a standstill. Interim Speaker P.M, of North Carolina upset at the far-right faction of his own party, sent lawmakers home to cool off with only about six weeks to prevent a government shutdown. Members will return to Capitol on Tuesday, with an expected vote for the next speaker taking place the following day. Two conservative hardliners have already thrown their hat into the ring. Majority Leader S.S and Ohio Congressman J.J. Until then, the People’s House is closed for business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a second day, half of the US Congress is paralyzed and will remain so indefinitely raising fears Congress is barreling again toward a painful government shutdown. K.M’s name still hangs above the doorway, but the fight to replace him is on. Top Republicans S.S and J.J both officially announced their candidacy today. But whether they have the votes to succeed and when the House will eventually reopen for business are both open questions. The interim speaker, North Carolina P.M had no answers on the days ahead. The only certainty among most Republicans today, their disdain for colleague M.G who led the charge to remove M. G today continue to attack his colleagues. The leadership vacuum and overall paralysis in the House is raising new worries about crashing into the new November 17th deadline to fund the government and avert a government shutdown. Also in danger, funding for Ukraine, which was left out of last weekend’s deal to avert a shutdown. The Pentagon warning Congress this week as it’s running out of money to replace weapons it sent to Ukraine. Any new speaker will have to contend with a growing number of House Republicans who think it’s time to turn off the spigot. &lt;strong&gt;There is another controversy. Former House Speaker N.P and Democratic Leader S.H say they were evicted from their Capitol hideaway offices, a perk for senior members. One of K.M allies says Republicans control the office space and that M now needs and it’s entitled to this space that’s been used by P. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight, the largest health care strike in American history is underway after tens of thousands of Kaiser Permanente workers walked off the job in five states and right here in DC. The union is asking for higher pay and better staffing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At dawn this morning, more than seventy five thousand workers at Kaiser Permanente walked out. Pharmacists, respiratory therapists, optometrists and other technicians. &lt;strong&gt;The union is asking for better working conditions and a $25 per hour minimum wage. Kaiser has offered $21 to $23 per hour. That&amp;rsquo;s just above what fast-food workers will soon make in California. &amp;ldquo;We have a lot of people who leave and they&amp;rsquo;re like, why would I work here for the same pay that I could make at Burger King or Target and not have to come in contact with infectious diseases?&amp;rdquo; Kaiser has a patient pool of nearly thirteen million people and more than three hundred thousand employees. Its profit so far this year tops $3.3 billion.&lt;/strong&gt; In a message to patients, Kaiser said &amp;ldquo;Our hospitals, emergency departments, and pharmacies will remain open&amp;hellip; We may need to reschedule non-urgent appointments and procedures.&amp;rdquo; The three-day walkout began as negotiations intensify for unions striking in other industries. Today autoworkers, culinary workers and screen actors are all at the bargaining table. The economic impact has been profound. Strikes around the country so far this year have meant a loss of nearly seven million work days, the most in generations.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 10.03.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.03.23/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Oct 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.03.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with this historic day right here in the nation’s capital. &lt;strong&gt;For the first time in the history of American democracy and the first Congress of seventeen 1789, the Speaker of the House has been removed from his position as the leader of the chamber. By vote of 216 to 210, lawmakers booted Speaker K.M, throwing the House into chaos and into unprecedented territory.&lt;/strong&gt; M, seen here walking away from the chamber in bitter defeat after facing an uprising from the far-right faction of his own party. Florida Congressman M.G a long-time critic and thorn in the side of M, led the revolt after the now former speaker worked with Democrats on a funding bill to avoid a government shutdown. Only eight Republicans voted to vacate the chair, but two hundred and eight Democrats refused to come to M’s rescue and save his speakership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M speakership lasted nine months, with critics inside his own party threatening to move on him throughout. Today, they made their move and left half of the US Congress in a state of uncertainty. For the first time in the history, the US House stripped its speaker of his job. Hours after the vote, M blasted the Republicans who unseated him and announced he won’t run for speaker again. K.M’s rocky leadership of one of the most narrow majorities ever in the House of Representatives, which he earned only after a marathon fifteen round drama in January, ended with dramatic flourish as eight Republicans joined all House Democrats to remove him. Florida Republican M.G led the challenge citing complaints about M’s deal with President B to avert a debt ceiling crisis in May and the eleventh-hour deal to avert a government shutdown Saturday in which M secured more support among Democrats than Republicans. For now, the House turns to a temporarily Speaker, North Carolina Republican P.M until a formal vote occurs to choose a new speaker. M had hoped some Democrats would vote to save him, but they decided to back his removal after watching video this morning in a private meeting of M on Sunday’s Face the Nation blaming Democrats after they helped him avert a shutdown.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 10.02.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.02.23/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Oct 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.02.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, after years of D.T bragging about his net worth, a trial in New York is underway and taking direct aim at just that. The fraud trial at former president, his family and the T organization started today. Prosecutors accused T and his family of inflating the value of his assets and net worth on financial documents. Before entering the court room, T called the trial a shame and verbally attacked the judge and New York’s attorney general L.J. Last week, the same judge found T, his son D, E and the T organization had inflated the its value by billions of dollars for a decade. This isn’t a criminal case so no jail time but T could be forced to give up his famous New York properties like T. Tower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former President T did not need to be here today, but he decided to show up. Sources tell me for him, this is deeply personal. And he wants to defend the business that is so intertwined with his life and whole career. Former President D.T set stoneface in court this morning. The fate of his New York properties including T. Tower and his family business at stake. New York attorney general L.J who brought the two hundred- and fifty-million-dollar fraud law suit against T and his adult children sat just feet away from the former President and his son E. T used the occasion to attack the J and the judge. T was accused of misrepresenting his net worth by over three and a half billion dollars, inflating his assets to secure better loan term. He allegedly claimed his T. Tower penthouse was nearly three times in size. And valued Mar-A-Lago as seven hundred thirty-nine million dollars, nearly ten times of its worth according to J’s office. Attorney K.W told the judge “They were lying year after year after year”. T’s former fixer M.C said in a deposition played in court that he and former T organization CFO A.W were tasked inflating assets to obtain the number that T wanted. T attorney C.K called C a serial liar and said “everyone has a different opinion as to valuation”. The former president called the trial a witch hunt.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 10.01.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.01.23/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Oct 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.01.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight in Washington where President B is urging lawmakers to finish their work after Congress barely avoided a government shutdown this weekend. Funding was due to run out today but now be temporarily extended through the middle of next month. The bipartisan vote Saturday has angered some House Republicans with one GOP lawmaker pushing to oust Speaker K.M as soon as this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The funding fight may be over for now, but the political infighting continues here on Capitol Hill. And President B says he has had enough. An exasperated President B blamed House Republicans for putting the federal government on the verge of shutdown. The president urged lawmakers to keep their commitment on aid to Ukraine after it was abruptly dropped from the final package. The stopgap measure only funds federal agencies for forty-five days through November 17th. And includes sixteen billion dollars in relief for communities hit by natural disasters. The bill passed the House and Senate late Saturday with overwhelming bipartisan support. The Congressman M.G blasted House Speaker K.M for working with Democrats. The Florida Republican accuses Speaker of reneging on a pledge to rein in spending and threatened a motion to remove him from the speakership this week. House Republicans were split on the potential move which will likely require support from Democrats.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 09.30.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.30.23/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Oct 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.30.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight in Washington, where, with just hours to spare before a midnight deadline. Congress has reached agreement to avert a government shutdown. This afternoon, the House passed a short-term spending bill that provides funding to federal agencies for forty-five days. The measure was later approved by the Senate, and the line of cars waiting outside the Capitol suggested to the media that the vote would be quick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One Congressman described it as college student waiting till the last minute to cram for an exam. The US House passed a forty-five days extension of keeping the government open. The Senate followed suit after a day of scrambling and compromise. With millions of federal workers from military bases to TSA checkpoints to government medical facilities poised to lose their paychecks when the clock struck midnight, the US House tried to hit the snooze button and agreed to a brief, forty-five days plan to keep the government open. For days, the US House has been gridlocked as House Speaker K.M tried and failed to pass a bill to fund the government with only Republican votes. Today, he agreed to a deal both parties accepted. The plan had no changes to current spending, but also eliminated money to help the Ukraine was effort which some Republicans had opposed paying for and which Democrats said it must be addressed and readded in November. The deal includes billions of dollars in recovery money for areas recently devastated by natural disasters including flood-ravaged Vermont and hurricane victims including Florida. But Speaker M immediately took heat from some conservative Republicans for cutting a deal with Democrats. Just ahead of votes, as Democrats complained about a rushed process, New York Democrat J.B was accused of pulling a firm alarm in a House office building, which House leaders say they’ll investigate. B declined CBSN’s request for an interview and then issued a statement saying he didn’t realize he would trigger a building alarm as he was rushing to make an urgent vote.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 09.29.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.29.23/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Sep 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.29.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, the Big Apple is in a big mess. And tens of millions of Americans are experiencing torrential rain and record flooding. Heavy downpours are expected to continue through the night and into Saturday in the Northeast with remnants of tropical storm Ophelia lingering. Large parts of the nation’s most populous city, New York, were paralyzed today. Subway lines turned into waterfalls and buses looked more like boats. Residents are urged to stay indoors as dangerous flooding covers entire neighborhoods. Record rainfall is falling across the city with Manhattan’s Central Park getting more than four inches in just three hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The issue in this part of the country is that the ground is just fully saturated with rain falling seventeen out of the last eighteen weekends and much of the last week.&lt;/strong&gt; In fact, the historic rainfall in this part of the country is on par right now with a once in one-hundred-year event. Brooklyn was in the bull’s eye today with a torrential storm overwhelming city streets. More than half a foot of a rain fell, bringing with it, life-threatening flooding. Those floods may travel treacherous. Countless drivers were stuck when the water overtook busy highways. One driver seen with their legs out the window.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 09.28.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.28.23/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Sep 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.28.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin with the federal government facing a shutdown, now just two days away. But today, House Republicans were focused on other issues. Principally, the first hearing in the impeachment inquiry of President J.B. House leaders are accusing the president of corruption and abuse of office, while Democrats say the entire process is an evidence-free waste of time. In testimony, some of the GOP’s own witnesses did not agree with those who invited them saying there is not enough evidence to support articles of impeachment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was little new evidence presented during this impeachment hearing, and Democrats blasted Republicans for holding it while the government is in danger of shutting down. After months of investigation, House Republicans began their first impeachment proceeding seeking to tie President B to his son H and his family’s business dealings. The White House has denied any wrongdoing, and minutes into the hearing, the panel’s own GOP witnesses knocked some of the allegations down. Democrats mocked the hearing as a sham. And they called it a distraction from the looming government shutdown with the countdown clock ticking by the minute. Leaders in both chambers to advance separate short-term funding packages. If they fail to pass, a partial shutdown could result in shuttered national parks, hundreds of thousands of federal workers, and essential employees like the military, federal law enforcement and TSA forced to work without pay.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 09.27.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.27.23/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Sep 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.27.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with the scandal on Capitol Hill and a siting United States Senator in federal court for charges of bribery and corruption. Senator B.M and his wife pleaded not guilty today accused of accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars of bribe in form of cash, gold bars and a luxury vehicle. Well, the Senator was released on one hundred thousand dollars bond and his wife set a two hundred fifty thousand. Calls for his resignation are growing with thirty democratic Senators now saying he should step down. Three New Jersey businessmen were also charged in the bribery scheme pleaded not guilty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senator M was serious and respectful in court although at times he did crack a few smiles and consoled his wife while more of his senate colleagues abandoned him politically. New Jersey Senator R.M arrived in federal court hand in hand with his wife N. The couple were in the same row as they were arraigned and pleaded not guilty to three felony charges including conspiracy to commit bribery, fraud and extortion. The senator responded “yes your honor” when asked if he understood the charges against him. He was ordered to surrender his personal passport. According to the indictment, M and his wife allegedly accepted bribes nearly five hundred thousand dollars in cash found in pockets of a coat bearing his name, over one thousand dollars’ worth of gold bars and a sixty thousand dollars Mercedes convertible in exchange for his effort to direct federal aid and weapons sales to Egypt. He is also accused of enriching three business partners who also pleaded not guilty. CBSN has learned the FBI is investigating whether Egypt intelligence services try to gain access to the Senator with his wife.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 09.26.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.26.23/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Sep 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.26.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin with breaking news. A judge just ruling that D.T, his sons Don Jr. and Eric, and the entire T Organization committed extensive and persistent fraud over a decade. The ruling says the former president the value of his assets by billions of dollars and then lied about his net worth on financial documents to banks and insurance companies. This now leads to the cancellation of the company’s New York business license, which means the T Organization could lose control over properties like T Tower in Midtown Manhattan. Tonight’s decision is a major win for New York Attorney General L.J, who is seeking a fine of $250 million and a permanent ban on the T Organization including T himself from doing business in New York state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D.T launched his political career saying he’d mastered the art of deal. The judge has ruled T inflated some of his net worth and some of those deals. A judge has found D.T engaged in fraud overinflating the worth of his real estate holdings and misleading banks and insurers. The ruling comes days before the T Organization is to stand trial in a civil case alleging years of fraud and misconduct, brought by New York Attorney General L.J last year. In the ruling, the judge found T and top executives at the T Organization lied about his assets in order to secure favorable loans and lower insurance premiums. In one instance, claiming his ten thousand square foot apartment was roughly thirty thousand square feet. The judge summarizing T’s approach to bookkeeping, “This is a fantasy world, not the real world”. The lawsuit from Attorney General J seeks a quarter of a billion dollars. When T was deposed in the case in August of last year, he pleaded the Fifth and repeated it more than four hundred times. T has repeatedly denied wrongdoing and lashed out at J for bringing the suit. In a statement to CBSN, a T spokesperson calls the ruling fundamentally flawed. The judge also ordered sanctions of some of T’s attorneys saying some of the arguments were “frivolous”.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 09.25.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.25.23/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Sep 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.25.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We want to begin tonight with one of the longest Hollywood strikes in history coming to a possible end with the Writers Guild of America and the major studios agreeing to a tentative deal. A potential agreement, announced late last night comes nearly five months since production came to a standstill. What followed was months of bitter talks, picket lines, and round-the-clock negotiations over demands including residuals and the use of artificial intelligence. Now, the terms are not yet known, but in an email to members, the WGA said the deal had meaningful gains and protections for writers. Members of the union still need to ratify the new contract, so writers won’t be returning to work immediately. Attention now turns to the ongoing strikes of members of the Screen Actors Guild, with many of the same issues on the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a hundred and forty-six days of picket lines, writers are expected to ratify this deal within the coming weeks. But with actors on strike, there’s still no Hollywood ending. Picket signs are coming down, but don’t expect the curtain to rise anytime soon for your favorite shows. While the writers have reached a deal, it still must be ratified by the guild’s eleven thousand members and more than one hundred sixty thousand actors are still without a contract. The WGA calls its three-year deal “exceptional”. It includes concessions on royalty payments for streaming and protecting writers from being replaced by AI, two of the main sticking points of strike that has cost the industry more than five billion dollars. The first shows forced off the air, late-night talk shows, will likely be the first programs to return, perhaps as early as next week. The writers’ and actors’ walkouts have shown strong solidarity, notably in the many job actions seen in this summer of strikes. It was only last week that studio heads were brought in to try to end the strike that lasted nearly five months. Now, with the ongoing actors strike, your favorite shows may not return until next year, and even then, there still could be more trouble ahead. Labor actions for other industries jobs are looming.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 09.24.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.24.23/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Sep 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.24.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, what has left of tropical storm Ophelia is slowly creeping up the east coast, bringing drenching rain and pounding winds. Flood warnings are posted from the Carolinas to as far north as Maine. In North Carolina, much of the town of Belhaven was left devastated as water crashed into front yards. And along the Jersey Shore, roads were submerged, stranding some in their homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And although it weakened, the remnants of Ophelia still impacting the east coast. Nearly nine million people are under coastal flooding alerts. Tonight, tens of thousands of people along the East Coast are still without power after dealing with twenty hours of destructive winds, heavy rain, and severe flooding. In Virginia, a state of emergency was declared. Overnight in North Carolina, roads were submerged. More than forty car accidents reported in Raleigh. The most serious when a tree fell on this car. The driver crashed, now hospitalized with a head injury. In Greenville, a small pit bull terrier found tied to a fence was rescued, just in time from rising waters. Another dramatic rescue in Cape Lookout, a helicopter lighting the way for Coast Guard to rescue five people including three children stranded on a thirty-eight-foot catamaran. Parts of Maryland seeing extended periods of heavy rainfall and elevated tides. Ocean City residents worried about what’s next. Heavy rains are expected New Jersey, New York and even as far as Boston.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 09.22.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.22.23/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Sep 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.22.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin with the shocking new details in the federal indictment of a powerful US Senator. And tonight, the calls for New Jersey’s B.M to resign are growing, including from the governor of his state and from his own party who say the three-term senator needs to step down immediately. A grand jury indicted the Democratic senator and his wife on three counts of conspiracy to commit bribery, extortion and fraud in a case alleging he aided a foreign government and New Jersey businessman. The thirty-nine-page indictment just unsealed today is astonishing in its scope. Prosecutors found hundreds of thousands of dollars inside the lawmaker’s house with cash stuffed in his congressional jacket with his name on it. And these gold bars that were wrapped in paper towels. In a statement, M denies any wrong doing. This is his second indictment in ten years, which is believed to be the first time in American history that a sitting US senator has been indicted on two separate criminal cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The senator faces prosecution and calls from inside his own party to resign, accused of leveraging his powerful seat here at the Senate to enrich himself. The indictment against New Jersey R.M and his wife vast corruption, trading political favors with three New Jersey businessmen in exchange for riches. &lt;strong&gt;Federal agents say when they raided the family home last summer, they found one hundred thousand dollars’ worth of gold bars, four hundred eighty thousand dollars in cash, some stuffed in envelopes found in a jacket bearing M’s name. And outside in the driveway, a sixty thousand dollars Mercedes Benz convertible allegedly given to them by one of the businessmen he helped. The indictment says agents discovered a Google search by M asking “how much is one kilo of gold worth”.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::tip 啊？
就这？
:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prosecutors allege M wielded his Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairmanship to help one of the businessmen, American-Egyptian W.H secure a lucrative contract in Egypt and helped H gets sensitive information about the US embassy in Cairo which was ultimately shared with the Egyptian government. They say the scheme started in 2018, just months after a mistrial was declared in a prior corruption case M was involved in. The new indictment details the involvement of M&amp;rsquo;s wife, Lebanese-born N.A whom he married in 2020 after ten months of dating. The senator is seen here serenading her at India&amp;rsquo;s Taj Mahal. A is accused of taking no-show job with H who allegedly had close ties to Egyptian intelligence. And according to the indictment, H in a text message to an Egyptian general referred to M as &amp;ldquo;our man&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/strong&gt; The sixty-nine-year old senator who will temporarily step aside from his role as committee chairman blasted the charges saying, &amp;ldquo;the excessess of these prosecutors is apparent. They have misrepresented the normal work of a Congressional office. On top of that, they have attacked my wife&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 09.21.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.21.23/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Sep 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.21.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with breaking news and a fatal bus crash involving a high school band in New York. Police say at least two adults are dead including a band director. Dozens injured and five students tonight are in critical conditions. The charter bus went off the interstate tumbling down an embankment about forty-five miles northwest of New York City. Images from the scene show the bus on its side, with its windows smashed out. Forty students and four adults were on the bus. Everyone taken to the hospital, some airlifted. While the marching band, including cheerleaders were heading to a band camp in Pennsylvania, the bus, a part of a caravan who watched their classmates crash, while the rest of the students, they headed back to their high school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The students were supposed to arrive to the camp in Greely, Pennsylvania, around 2:00 PM, according to a schedule post on their website. Instead, the bus some of them were traveling on plunged off the road just forty minutes before making it there. And police say a preliminary investigation shows that failure of a front tire may have contributed to the crash. Debris littered the scene along this New York interstate where a bus, chartered by the Farmingdale High school band landed in ravine after rolling down an embankment just outside Wawayanda, two hours northwest of New York City. The vehicle was part of a six-bus caravan of three hundred people heading to a band camp in Pennsylvania. Dozens of first responders rushed to the scene just after one 1:30 PM, forced to use ladders to rescue victims as the bus teetered among treetops. Some of the injured were pulled through windows. Crews also scoured the woods to find anyone who may have been ejected. There were forty-four passengers on the bus, forty students and four adults. At this time, we have two confirmed fatalities, both adults and several serious injurious including five critical. Traffic was shut down for hours, and tonight officials say it is unclear how the bus careened out of control. The National Transportation Safety Board will send a team here to investigate. They are expected to arrive on scene by tomorrow morning. The high school tells us it’s trying to reunite students with their parents now and some students told us earlier that this is so devastating, it’s something they never expected could have happened.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 09.20.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.20.23/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Sep 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.20.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile back here in Washington, sparks flew on Capitol Hill today as House Republicans accused Attorney General M.G of weaponizing the Department of Justice. The prosecution of D.T and the President’s son H.B were the main topics of questioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the outset, the Republican-led committee took a combative approach. Accusing the Justice Department Special Counsel investigations of targeting former president and going easy on the current president and his son. In forceful testimony spanning more than five hours Attorney General M.G pushed back. According to recent closed-door testimony, some officials told congressional investigators they could not recall D.W has led the probe since 2018, saying he did not have the ultimate authority to charge the President’s son. The Attorney General also disputed the testimony and handwritten notes from an IRS whistleblower that W claimed he was not the deciding person, insisting to lawmakers that W had the final say. While Republican investigators insist over twenty billion dollars in payments from foreign sources to the B family and their associates, Democrats say the probes are political motivated. While most of the hearings centered on the Special Counsel investigation of H.B, G offered no insight into W’s decision to seek Special Counsel status more than four years into the case.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 09.19.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.19.23/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Sep 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.19.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with President B visiting the United Nations to make the case for the rest of the world to continue its support for Ukraine in its ongoing war against Russia. President spoke for the United Nations General Assembly and urge the world leaders to remain united and stand with the people of Ukraine against Russia’s illegal war. Ukraine’s President Z also appeared in person for the first time since the war began to warn that unless Russia is stopped Ukraine won’t be the last country to face this kind of aggression. Z will travel later this week to right here in Washington to visit the White House and Capitol Hill in a bid for continued funding and weapons from Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking in English and in person, Ukrainian President V.Z warned more than a hundred world leaders that Russia might come for their country next if it isn’t stopped in Ukraine. Ukraine has already received hundreds of billions of dollars in international aid. But, as the conflict moves into its nineteenth month, there are concerns global coffers could dry up. At the UN, President B argued today that’s just what P is counting on. And yet, even in the US, some Republicans still aren’t sold on another twenty-four-billion-dollar aid package. Over the past four months, Ukraine has managed to retake pockets of territory using weapons from the US and other allies. But it’s slow going because the Russians have ceded minefields like this one, all along the six hundred miles front line. Today at the UN, a Russian official in the hall kept his eyes on his phone as Z accused his country of kidnapping hundreds of thousands of children. As he spoke, five Americans were celebrating their first day back on US soil, freed from captivity in Iran as part of a prisoner swap brokered by the B administration.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 09.18.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.18.23/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Sep 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.18.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Five American citizens tonight are on the final leg of their years-long journey to freedom. Just hours from now, prisoners who were wrongly detained inside Iran will arrive back in the US to Fort Belvoir, not far from where we are, here in the nation’s capital. It took months and months of secret diplomatic talks. And here is what we know about the high stakes deal. The US released six billion dollars of frozen Iranian oil funds and let five Iranians, who are facing charges for nonviolent crimes walk free. Republicans tonight are voicing concern about the money headed to Iran, a state sponsor of terrorism. Earlier today, we saw the Americans get their first taste of freedom in the years. The White House say President B had an emotional call with their families after they left Iran.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And these five American families will be reunited later tonight. President B called the family members and, as one said, for the first time in years there is light in their home. Joy and relief after the five Americans and two family members touched down in Qatar today and were handed over to US officials. Secretary of State A.B said he had an emotional conversation with the freed Americans. For fifty-year-old businessman S.A it is the end to an eight-year ordeal, according to his attorney. Iran detained environmentalist M.T in 2018, the same year businessman E.S was first arrested and held without trial in Iran’s notorious Evin Prison on what the US considers trumped-up espionage charges.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 09.17.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.17.23/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Sep 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.17.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, the head of the United Auto Workers tell CBSN that the historic strike could soon spread to other plants. Right now, thousands are on the picket lines at three factories in Michigan, Missouri and Ohio. That could slam the brakes on the economy. The Labor Department reports the US lost more than four million days of work due to strikes and lockouts last month. It is the highest level in more than twenty years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UAW confirms a meeting with General Motors today and called a negotiating session with Ford Saturday, reasonably productive. But Jericka, no deal yet, which means these workers remain on strike. Rallying the troops on day three of United Auto Workers strike against Detroit’s big three car makers. Negotiations resumed Saturday, yielding some progress, but so far, no deal to get any of the nearly thirteen thousand striking workers off the picket line and back on the production line. The Union is currently seeking at least a thirty six percent raise cost of living and job protections, as well as an unwinding of concessions made during the Great Recession back in 2007. Automaker offers center around a raise of about twenty percent. Friday at midnight, workers at plants belonging to Ford, General Motors, and Chrysler parent, Stellantis in Michigan, Missouri and Ohio walked off the job when the union contract expired. Citing the ripple effect of the strike, Ford says it has had to temporarily lay off about six hundred workers at this plant. And General Motors says it expects to have to idle a plant in Kansas that employs more than two thousand people as soon as Monday.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 09.16.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.16.23/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Sep 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.16.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight in Texas. Today, the state’s Attorney General K.P was acquitted of all articles of impeachment including charges that he was unfit for office and of bribery. P’s political survival follows a decade of scandals that had threatened to demolish the Republican’s career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it was House Republicans who decided to bring impeachment charges against the attorney general, only two Senate Republicans voted against him on any of the charges. And it wasn’t enough to impeach Paxton. After less than twenty-four hours of deliberation. Republicans entered the Texas chamber together and then for the most part voted together as well. Twenty-one votes were needed on any of the sixteen articles of impeachment K.P faced. But he was acquitted on each count. Following the proceedings, Texas L Governor D.P reinstated P as the attorney general and criticize the Texas House for voting to impeach him in the first place. In May, the GOP-controlled Texas House chamber voted overwhelmingly to impeach Paxton. Prosecutors argue that the attorney general had among other things used his position to help a prominent real estate developer under federal investigation in exchange for developer giving P alleged mistress a job in Austin so the couple could be closer together. P’s wife State Senator A.P watched all the proceedings from the chamber but was not allowed to vote on her husband’s case.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 09.15.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.15.23/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Sep 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.15.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin with historic strike against all of America’s big three automakers. Tonight, the impact already felt with Ford revealing it will temporarily lay off six hundred non-striking workers at its Michigan assembly plant. General Motors expects to shut down its Fairfax plant in Kansas City as early as next week. Official say there is movement into negotiations but both sides remain far apart. President B who ran as a pro-union candidate is sending two of his top aides to Detroit to meet with both sides. As of midnight, about thirteen thousand began their strikes at assembly plants in Missouri, Michigan and Ohio, impacting General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis, the parent company of Jeep and Chrysler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The union says there were no negotiations today. Both sides expect them to resume tomorrow. UAW did make a counteroffer to the big three late last night, but the companies say the asks were still far too great and then time ran out. Outside idled auto plants in three states and in downtown Detroit just feet from the annual Auto Show, striking United Auto Workers making their voice heard. At the stroke of midnight, twelve thousand seven hundred UAW workers walked off the production line and joined the picket line. Halting work at factories in Michigan, Missouri and Ohio belonging to the nation’s big three automakers in an unprecedented move to strike for General Motors and Stellantis simultaneously.

A federal grand jury in Delaware indicting H.B on three-gun charges. The president’s youngest son could face up to twenty-five years in prison if he is found guilty of the felony counts, all stemming from his purchase of a firearm at a time when he was using drugs. Special Counsel D.W alleges B lied about his addiction on paperwork and illegally obtained a gun. Per the ATF, it is against the law for a user of certain controlled substances, including cocaine to possess a firearm. Today’s news comes less than two months after a plea agreement between H.B and federal prosecutors fell apart after the judge refused to sign off on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an extraordinary situation for Attorney General whose department is prosecuting the leading candidate for the GOP nomination. Former President D.T and the president’s son at the same time who is facing new legal jeopardy. The three felony counts H.B faces stemmed from his possession of a handgun in October 2018 identified a court record as a Colt Cobra thirty-eight special revolver. The president’s son is accused of making a false and fictitious statement about his drug use on a federal gun form into a firearms dealer. The third count alleges he did knowingly possess a firearm while on drugs. H.B has openly admitted his past struggle with addiction as he told CBS Sunday Morning. And while the president had no comment about his son today, he has long defended him.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 09.13.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.13.23/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Sep 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.13.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with a dramatic end of a two-week manhunt for an escaped killer in Pennsylvania. Fugitive D.C was captured early this morning after a DEA plane picked up his heat signal. We are just getting this new mugshot police found with a rifle in his possession. It was a police dog who bit C’s scalp and ultimately latched onto his thigh, likely putting him in excruciating pain. He was found in a wooded area about twenty miles from the prison. The massive manhunt involved five hundred members of law enforcement working around the clock, including officials with the state police, FBI, ATF, US Marshalls Service, and the border patrol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State police say, once in motion, the capture of D.C today happened within five minutes. Tonight, he is in custody at SCI Phoenix, a maximum-security prison Northwest of Philadelphia to serve life-sentence for first degree murder. Now, police are revealing how the massive search came to a dramatic end. Police say a burglar alarm went off within their search perimeter just after midnight. About an hour later, an aircraft using a thermal technology picked up a signal, and just before 8 AM this morning, tactical units surrounded C as he tried to escaped with a stolen rifle. But law enforcement released a K9 to hold him. C was seen wearing a Philadelphia Eagles football sweatshirt. His face bloodied from a dog-bite injury to his scalp.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 09.12.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.12.23/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Sep 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.12.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with breaking news right here in Washington and the impeachment inquiry of President B. Speaker of the House K.M claims House investigators have uncovered a quote, “culture of corruption” surrounding the president and his family. The demands for the review. The White House called today’s actions politically motivated and several Republicans have produced no evidence of wrongdoing. Now, this is taking place as M is facing mounting pressure from the right wing of his own party along with the deadline to pass a spending bill before October 1st in order to avoid a government shut down. Now, all this and the 2024 presidential election is just around the corner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a significant escalation in the GOP impeachment effort, and tonight, the House Speaker is urging the President B to cooperate with this new inquiry. The White House insists the facts don’t justify this move, and a number of Republicans appear to agree. The announcement was a reversal for House Speaker M, who just two weeks ago said he would not launch an impeachment inquiry unless he had the votes for it. But M was facing mounting pressure from conservatives who threaten to sink his speakership if he didn’t act. To lead the new inquiry, M tapped three House chairs who have already been probing the B family’s foreign business dealings. A White House spokesman noted today House Republicans have been investigating the President for nine months and they’ve turned up no evidence of wrongdoing. Back in 2019, M warned his predecessor, N.P, that launching an impeachment inquiry into President T without holding a vote first would create a process completely devoid of any merit or legitimacy. But, with his party divided, any vote today would likely have failed. In the Senate, several Republicans were skeptical today that the inquiry would go anywhere. But House Conservatives argued the move will give them access to key family documents they don’t have now. A White House official who we speak with today pointed out that the House has actually already subpoenaed and received twelve thousand pages of bank records, and without a formal vote it’s not clear that simply announcing this inquiry will give the House more authority to investigate that it had already.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 09.11.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.11.23/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Sep 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.11.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight overseas with a race against time, as rescue teams in Morocco scour the ruble in a furious search for survivors. The area’s strongest earthquake in more than a century has killed nearly three thousand with thousands more injured, but those numbers are expected to rise in the hours and days ahead. The destruction and devastation are beyond words, with at least one hundred thousand children impacted by the disaster and that’s according to UNICEF. The epicenter of the 6.8 quake is located in the country’s High Atlas Mountains where buildings crumbled and left communities cut off from the outside world. Villagers digging by hand or shovels because getting heavy equipment into these remote areas has been nearly impossible. International groups including specially trained dogs, have joined local rescue efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re still in that crucial time known as the golden period, the best window for finding people who may still be alive trapped beneath the rubble. Now, more than seventy-two hours since the quake, that windows is closing. Day three of the rescue effort with Moroccans clinging to the hope of finding survivors. But with every body removed from the rubble, hope is slipping through the blistered fingers they’ve been digging with. Across Morocco, footage captures the moment this North African country erupted into panic and now into a race as they search for the living and grieve for the dead. The heartache and destruction are worse here in the remote High Atlas, where twisting roads, steep cliffs, and rustic dwellings, the very things that make these mountains so jaw-dropping, made the earthquake and its aftermath so deadly. Many of these homes are made out of bricks, so they don’t just collapse, they crumble. And they don’t leave any air pockets for survivors, who tend to just choke to death on the dust. And if there was anyone to save, locals tell us, they had to save themselves. Towns are cut off and survivors forced to sleep on the streets. Aid has been slow to trickle in, and the government hasn’t allowed many foreign crews in. So much of the relief effort has relied on locals like these, driving back and forth to the grocery store in Marrakesh, more than thirty miles away, to bring food, water and supplies. Now, Morocco has been delivering aid, but this is a lot of remote ground to cover. US Secretary A.B says the US is standing by, ready to give help of its own, but Morocco has yet to accept that offer.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 09.10.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.10.23/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Sep 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.10.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, the pictures from Morocco are astonishing. Even as the scope of Friday’s earthquake disaster is still unfolding. Today, President B expressed his condolences to the North African Country. Secretary of State A.B said the US is ready to help. The death toll now at twenty-one hundred is expected to rise as rescuers desperately try to find survivors in the rubble. The US Geological survey put the quake that struck Friday at 6.8 in magnitude. Homes and buildings collapsed, including in the old city of Marrakesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here in the ancient city of Marrakesh, people are forced to sleep outside for the third night in a row as the death toll around the country is climbing. The jolting moment the quake rips through the country. CCTV footage shows terrified Moroccans fleeing for their lives as buildings ancient and new collapse all around them. The worse devastation in the scenic high Atlas Mountains, where rescuers are racing to reach survivors trapped beneath the debris. Others are less fortunate. Untold victims remain trapped in areas cut off from aid, where grinding roads and landslides make much of the quake zone difficult, and in some cases, impossible to reach so far. Many of those within reach have sustained serious injuries. An estimated two thousand people like A.A, who can barely move or speak. While in cities like Marrakesh and its famed Kasbah, medieval buildings that have stood for a millennium could topple at any moment if they haven’t already. Here in Marrakesh, these ancient walls made of mud and brick, one of the very things that makes this city just so picturesque, have now made it so dangerous. Fearful of the aftershocks, tourists are among the distressed. The US embassy tells us that they’re aware of a small number of injured Americans but of no deaths. They also tell us a team of US disaster experts have just arrived to help determine how Americans can also help in the humanitarian effort.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 09.08.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.08.23/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Sep 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.08.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin with breaking news on Hurricane Lee and its potential impacts on most of the east coast this weekend. Lee rapidly intensified from a category two doubling winds in twenty-four hours, and then briefly becoming the first category five hurricane of the season. Weather experts are watching this closely. They are concerned the storms like Lee that gain strength so quickly are happening more frequently. Heavy waves and hazardous ??? conditions are expected to impact much of the east coast beginning Sunday and Monday even while the storm is hundreds of miles out in Atlantic. Also tonight, we are tracking heavy thunderstorms that are rumbling across the northeast. In New Jersey, roads are flooded and trees are knocked down.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 09.07.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.07.23/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Sep 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.07.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin with the dangerous heat waves still smothering a large portion of the country including major cities like New York and Boston which both hit historic highs today. More than eighty million Americans are under heat alerts today. And more than sixty cities scorched in record-breaking temperatures. Fort Worth, Texas, hit one hundred and seven and Roswell, New Mexico, hit one hundred and five degrees. That is more than fifteen degrees above average for this time of year. And in the Atlantic, Hurricane Lee is now a category four and is gaining momentum fueled by the unusually warm waters. The late-summer heat is putting pressure on schools unable to keep students safe because they don’t have air conditionings. Many districts canceling school or sending students home early as high temperatures force officials to rethink how they can operate in this extreme weather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than a million students here in New York City went back to school today, but with a heat advisory still in effect, schools are limiting outdoor activities. Students in the nation’s largest public school district headed back to the sweltering sun today. The majority of New York City public schools have air conditioning after spending millions of dollars in 2017. The heat was on in Massachusetts today too but in Boston, the first day back was a breeze. Last year, Boston public schools installed thirty-eight hundred air conditioners, partially funded by federal pandemic programs. Now, the nine million dollars investment is having a big payoff. A recent study found that students scored increasingly worse on standardized tests when temperature were above eighty degrees. Dozens of districts across ten states have been forced to close or dismiss early this week because of inadequately cooled classrooms.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 09.06.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.06.23/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Sep 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.06.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We want to begin tonight with new details in the brazen breakout and manhunt that has captured international attention. Hundreds of law enforcement officers from multiple agencies are looking for D.C, and we finally know how the dangerous fugitive escaped from a prison outside Philadelphia. Look at this new video. The convicted killer is seen scaling between two walls, moments later escaping to freedom. And we now know this is how another inmate escaped in May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight, we are seeing newly released video of D.C’s daring escape from prison, the escaped murderer crab-walks up the prison wall, then jumps down to a less secure area before pushing through razor wire to exit the facility. The tower guard has been placed on leave. C was awaiting transfer to a state prison after he received a life sentence for killing his ex-girlfriend. An inmate was escaped from the same prison in May used a similar method. Hundreds of police officers along with federal agencies including the FBI and Border Patrol are flooding yards and searching cars. Today, a train passing through the area was stopped and also searched. Police say C was last seen overnight near the area they’re searching. On Monday, photos showed him on a trail camera at a nearby botanical garden, and on Saturday, a home surveillance camera recorded him passing through a yard. All this just a few miles from where police say he was spotted shortly after his escape on Thursday morning. Police say they’ve confirmed seven total sightings of C. Something working against in this search is the undergrowth. It is so thick searchers can only go a few feet before losing sight of each other. Two Pennsylvania School districts are once again closed as the community grows increasingly frustrated.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 09.05.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.05.23/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Sep 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.05.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin with the breaking news from the federal courthouse right here in Washington. Thirty-nine-year-old, once the top leader of the far-right extremist group the Proud Boys was just sentenced to twenty-two years in federal prison for orchestrating the failed plot to forcibly block the peaceful transfer of power following the 2020 presidential election. It’s the longest sentence yet stemming from the January 6 assault on the US Capitol but not as long as the thirty-three years requested by prosecutors. He begged the judge for mercy saying “I’m not a political zealot.” But did not receive that mercy.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 09.04.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.04.23/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Sep 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.04.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin with tonight’s mud-delayed exodus from Burning Man. That’s the counterculture art festival held every year on what is typically a dry and dusty bed in the Nevada Desert. But over the weekend, a major downpour turns the ground there into thick mud, the cement-like sludge stranding more than seventy thousand people and forcing them sheltering in place and conserve food and water. Conditions at the makeshift city quickly turned bleak. One death was reported although there are no details yet on the cause of that death. With the ground so wet, many who tried to leave the remote area were stuck spinning their wheels or knee deep in mud. Tonight, the only road out is finally dry enough for people to slowly start making their way back to civilization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are right outside the camp site. And you can see just how remote this is about one hundred and forty miles from Reno. They may look like ants on your screen. But thousands of cars are snaking through the desert, barely moving. Today finally was moving day. But it was slow slog. Tens of thousands attending the event that celebrates being off the grid have been stuck in gridlock. There is just one road to leave the isolated Black Rock Desert. After two months of rain fell in one day. Burning Man officials warned festival goers to shelter in place. Not to try to make the more than five-mile trek out. The mud so thick even large vehicles couldn’t move. And those who chose to walk barefoot risked chemical burns because the mud is alkaline. Many took the risk to leave early, posting as they went.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 09.03.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.03.23/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Sep 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.03.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, millions are under flood alerts and life-threatening monsoon swamped the southwest. In Nevada, police are investigating a death at the popular Burning Man Festival. Thousands are still stranded in the mud-soaked Black Rock City where two months’ worth of rain fell in just two days. Organizers are warning people still in the desert area to conserve water and fuel. And in San Bernadino, California, several roads there are impassable, even for big rigs like these after storms swept through that area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Burning Man Festival is something is a celebration of art and creativity that happens every year. But heavy rains swamped the event, leaving many stuck and sheltering in place. Tens of thousands stranded at the Burning Man Festival forced to hunker down in the Nevada desert as authorities tell them to conserve food and water. As crews worked to clear a safe path out of the makeshift town, cell phone equipment is being brought in to help those who got stuck after heavy rain trapped them in flooded campsites. More rain could hit Southwest deserts. Thunderstorm already caused flash flooding in Arizona, Las Vegas, near the California-Arizona border. Now, some Burning Man Festival goers are trying to slog their way out in pickup trucks and RVs. Organizers say if they can clear the way tomorrow, that traffic jam could be longer than twelve hours.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 09.01.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.01.23/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Sep 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.01.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin with the Labor Day travel rush in full swing. Americans are packing nation’s airports and hitting the road to mark the unofficial end of summer. More than one hundred and forty-eight Americans will leave homes according to one survey, making this one of the busiest travel weekends of the year. While most of the Americans will be driving, the TSA said it expects more than fourteen million fires through Tuesday. AAA says today will be one of the worst days to get behind the wheel because it will be one of the busiest. The best day to drive will be Sunday, with little traffic expected. AAA also says the most popular destinations are Seattle, Orlando, Anchorage, New York City and Las Vegas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has already been the busiest summer trave season on record and the TSA expects to get an 11% bump this Labor Day compare to last year. People flying today are finding very few cancelations but some weather related delays and there was some high flying drama overseas.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 08.31.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.31.23/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Sep 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.31.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with the devastating aftermath of hurricane Idalia, destroying homes and businesses from Florida to North Carolina. Take a look at this remarkable drone footage over the coastal town of Horseshoe Beach, Florida, the catastrophic damage brought on by the hurricane force winds and flood waters. Homes were ripped apart and debris scattered across the entire region. The video is the same, community after community up and down the coastline, with buildings knocked off their foundation or simply gone, replaced by wreckage. Insurance experts estimate the price tag of Idalia’s damage could reach as high as twenty billion dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than sixty-five National Guard troops are handing out supplies and helping with the clean ups. And this is what they are finding, piles of debris that used to be homes and businesses. Tonight, Floridians are sorting through the devastation left behind by Idalia. This was what Horseshoe Beach look like as an up to ten-foot storm roared through. And this is what’s left, homes reduced to piles of woods, businesses destroyed. Clean up efforts are ongoing on the island of Cedar Key. The powerful storm surge pounded these cottages. The water punched through the glass of this room over here. And as the water kept coming forward, it started pushing into the rooms, soaking everything and throwing it around. Keaton Beach was overwhelmed by an up-to-ten-foot storm surge.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 08.30.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.30.23/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Aug 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.30.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We come on the air with breaking news. At least two people are dead tonight as Hurricane Idalia leaves a path of destruction across Florida and slams Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina. The video after landfall is stunning. Idalia hit Florida’s Bid Bend region as a category three storm with maximum sustained winds of one hundred and twenty-five miles per hour. Tonight, hundreds of thousands of customers are still without power. We’re hearing stories tonight of survival. Some residents who rode out the storm at home say they had to escape by swimming out of their windows. The National Hurricane Center’s advisory is just in, Idali is now a tropical storm. But the risk of flooding, storm surge, and strong winds continues. And at this hour, there are reports of at least one tornado in South Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some neighborhoods here in Citrus County are still under water. This storm pummeled Florida’s Gulf Coast with heavy winds and torrential rains. And at its peak, more than two hundred and fifty thousand people were without power. Hurricane Idalia roared ashore at 7:45 this morning packing powerful one hundred and twenty-five miles per hour winds. The storm surge flooded hundred of miles Florida’s Gulf Coast. The eye came ashore near Keaton Beach which was nearly washed away by an eight-foot wall of water. Taylor County along the state’s Big Bend bore the brunt of the storm. The town of Perry took a direct hit. Trees were ripped down, homes and businesses damaged or destroyed, including this gas station canopy, blown completely over.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 08.29.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.29.23/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Aug 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.29.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We come on the air with breaking news and the new storm track from the National Hurricane Center. Hurricane Idalia is now a category two packing sustained winds near 100mph and gaining strength. The life-threatening storm is set to make landfall first thing tomorrow morning, but parts of Florida are getting heavy rain and winds right now. Extremely warm water temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico, largely from climate change and those persistent heat dome this summer are fueling this hurricane. Forecasters predict this storm could turn catastrophic, wiping out coastal communities along a section of the Gulf Coast. And it could be, and it probably will be the strongest storm to hit what’s called the Big Bend region, ever. And we are now learning Idalia will also hit Georgia and possibly South Carolina as a hurricane. Millions are under evacuation orders and thirty counties with life-threatening storm surge of ten to fifteen feet expected in some areas. To truly get a sense of the storm, take a look at this image from space. It spans some four hundred miles wide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are starting to see some rain here in North Central Florida. But for residents who stayed behind, the Citrus County Sheriff just told me that once sustained winds reach forty-five miles an hour, his deputy cannot safely go out. So, if a resident has a problem, they are going to wait after the storm passes. Idalia’s initial impact was felt from the Florida Keys up to Tampa. High winds, heavy rains and some floodings. The eye of the storm is taking aim at the Big Bend region of Florida Gulf Coast which is bracing for hurricane force winds of at least one hundred eleven miles per hour. Authorities urgently telling residents in mobile homes and areas prone to flooding to get out now. Evacuation orders have been issued for more than two dozen counties. In Cedar Key, there’s only one bridge to get on and off the island. Some fear those staying behind could be trapped after the storm. Preparing for the worse, patients are being moved out of hospitals and care centers, close to one hundred of the most vulnerable have been evacuated to higher ground.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 08.28.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.28.23/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Aug 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.28.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We are tracking increasingly dangerous situation down in Florida where two third of the state is under a state of emergency preparing for a major hurricane. Within the next thirty-six hours, the National Weather Service warns that tropical storm Idalia was strengthen to at least category three. Right now, the system is in the Caribbean, stalled over Cuba. The warm waters fueling the storm on its path to slam Florida’s Gulf Coast. Millions in the Sunshine State are under evacuation orders. Governor R.D telling Floridians, get to higher grounds and stay somewhere that can handle a hurricane of this magnitude. And we’re learning that President B spoke with the Republican governor this morning, offering the help of federal government for storm preps and clean up. Nearly eleven hundred National Guard members now activated and there are sandbag locations open and ready to help prepare for the catastrophic storm surge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, where I am, Pinellas County officials are not taking any chances. Nearly thirty-six hours before is set to hit some areas are already under mandatory evacuation orders and those people need to get to higher grounds. This is the first major hurricane to hit Florida this year and it’s going to bring with it strong winds and life-threatening storm surge. It’s all hands on deck in Tampa’s Hillsborough County, residents preparing for the potential power of Hurricane Idalia, filing sandbags, bracing for up to eleven feet of storm surge along the Florida coast. Nineteen counties are under evacuation orders. Officials warning millions of residents along Florida’s West Coast to get to higher ground. Supplies are quickly running out. This woman grabbed the last few remaining gallons of water at this Publix. Residents are being asked to keep their gas tanks at least half full. But there are concerns after gas was contaminated at twenty-nine gas stations across Florida. Tampa International Airport will close at midnight and will remain closed until after the storm.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 08.27.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.27.23/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Aug 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.27.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, the FBI is investigating a deadly attack in Jacksonville, Florida. It’s where the police say a gunman shot and killed two Black shoppers and an employee because of their race. It happened Saturday. The masked white man was carrying at least one weapon bearing a swastika. The victims identified today, their ages range from nineteen to fifty-two. Today, President B denounced the attack saying “White supremacy has no place in America”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A vigil is being held tonight near the scene, as today, we are getting a look at chilling surveillance video showing the moments just prior to the shooting. A mass shooting at Dollar General in a predominantly Black Jacksonville neighborhood was unquestionably motivated by race according to the city sheriff. Just released surveillance video shows the shooter holding a rifle as he entered the store on Saturday. Police say he wore bullet-resistant arm and used a handgun along with an AR-15 semiautomatic rifle to killed three black people inside. Today, investigators say the gunman, twenty-one-year-old R.P, obtained the weapons legally and issued racist statements before the shooting. Photos also show his weapons covered in Nazi symbols. The shooter first went to the nearby campus of historically Black Edward Waters University. A security guard there turned him away after he refused to identify himself before police say he went to the Dollar General. The sheriff told me the assailant left behind ramblings addressed to his parents, the media, and the FBI, but that those hate-filled messages do not represent the Jacksonville community.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 08.26.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.26.23/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Aug 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.26.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin with breaking news in Jacksonville, Florida where there are multiple fatalities following a standoff between gunman and police at Dollar General Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Law enforcement officials say the shooter is a white male in his 20s who was motivated by hate. All three victims in this shooting were Black. The shooting happened at a Dollar General store in the northwest part of the city in the middle of the day. Jacksonville authorities say the suspect killed two males and one female before turning the gun on himself. The sheriff says the shooter put on a mask and tactical vest in the parking lot. He left behind multiple messages which authorities say amounted to an ideology of hate. This comes in the midst of a weekend waves of gun violence. Today in Boston, at least seven people were shot during the city’s annual Caribbean Carnival. Two suspects have been arrested. In Oklahoma last night players and fans rushed for cover when shots were fired at a high school football game. A sixteen-year-old boy was killed. No suspect arrested. And in Chicago, two women were shot and wounded in the stands at a White Sox game last night. And back to that unfolding situation in Jacksonville, the FBI is investigating it as a hate crime. And a federal civil right investigation is also underway.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 08.25.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.25.23/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Aug 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.25.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with what may become the enduring image of the forty fifth president of the United States, D.T. He made history last night as the first American president to have his mugshot taken after being booked on charges at the Fulton County jail in Atlanta. He was released twenty minutes later. He is the Republican frontrunner for the 2024 nomination and is using his booking photo to raise money for his campaign, rallying supporters following his fourth indictment this year. In this case, all of T’s eighteen co-defendants have now surrendered to authorities on charges of attempting to overturn the results of the 2020 election in Georgia. The formal arraignments for all nineteen defendants are expected to begin the first week in September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been another dramatic day of developments with one defendant denied bond late today and ordered back into custody after jail. By noon Friday, the last of T’s co-defendants turned themselves in to the Fulton County jail including former Justice Department official J.C who has accused of drafting a false letter to Georgia officials about the 2020 election. The final two to surrender, S.L and T.K, an ex-publicist for rapper K.W. Both are accused of intimidating election worker R.F. Thursday, former President was escorted into the jail for processing, getting a mugshot and an inmate number. He was recorded with at an eyebrow-raising six foot three and two hundred fifteen pounds with blond or strawberry hair. The former president got help from a local bail bond company to post his two hundred thousand dollars bond. T’s campaign starts to selling mugshot merchandise and after being banned from Twitter following the January 6th attack, T returned to the platform now known as X for the first time with a fund-raising appeal. President B, who tweeted out his own fund-raising plea as T was being arrested, was asked about the mugshot. The former President and his eighteen co-defendants could face arraignment early next month. District Attorney F.W has proposed a court date of October 23, 2023 after defendant K.C asked for a speedy trial. A judge granted the request for him, but T’s legal team says it’s opposed.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 08.24.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.24.23/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Aug 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.24.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin with breaking news. Former President D.T just surrender at the notorious Fulton County jail in Atlanta. T booked, processed on thirteen charges including conspiracy and racketeering related to attempts to overturn the 2020 election. Like all other people walked through the doors of that jail, the former president was fingerprinted, had his weight reported and a mugshot was taken. T joins eleven of his co-defendants in turning himself in. Just hours ago, former White House Chief of Staff M.M surrendered at the same jail. The remaining seven have until noon tomorrow to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This area is completely locked down as former President T turned himself in accompanied by a new lawyer that he hired just hours before the surrender. Tonight, former President joined eleven of his fellow co-defendants, booked, fingerprinted and photographed. The former president was processed in less than an hour and treated just like any other criminal defendant at the Fulton County jail, which is under investigation by the department of justice for poor conditions. Outside the jail, protesters stood by their man. T’s bond was set at two hundred thousand dollars. He’s charged with thirteen counts including racketeering, criminal conspiracy and making false statements for his alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election in Georgia, stemming from this call with Secretary of State B.R.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 08.23.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.23.23/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Aug 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.23.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with a mystery unfolding in Russia after a private jet crashed nearly two hundred miles north of Moscow. Believed to be onboard, Russian mercenary leader Y.P and his number two commander of the Wagnor Group. The big question tonight was the plane brought down intentionally, and was this a revenge for a failed mutiny that P led two months ago? The Wagnor Group was the tip of the spear in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine before he became disillusioned with the military’s leadership. The rebellion came to a sudden plot after striking a deal with P in exchange for amnesty. Photos of the crash site show plane wreckage engulfed in flames. Two pilots, one flight attendant, and seven passengers were on board, and there are no survivors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with so many stories out of Russia, it’s difficult to get accurate reviews and details are still very murky. But here in Ukraine, Y.P will not be missed. He is regarded as a war criminal. This footage shows the plane plunging from the sky with a missing wing and then crashing. Wagnor social media channels claim it is Y.P’s private jet, which was shot down. Russian aviation authorities simply say the plane crashed north of Moscow, killing all ten people on board, including P and that the cause is being investigated. But President B says he doesn’t know for sure what happened but he is not surprised. P was last seen in this recruitment video standing in an arid desert, rifle in hand at an undisclosed location in Africa. It is the first video since his aborted mutiny, which he called off at the 11th hour prompting raised eyebrows that he had not only challenged V.P but escaped almost unscathed. The former convict got his start selling hot dogs, eventually becoming P’s private caterer and confidante. During first Russian invasion on Ukraine on 2014. He made the leap from chef to warlord. Wagnor soldiers started to showing up in Syria, then across Africa. While his hired guns deal in death, P has made billions plundering natural resources in places like the Central Africa Republic. Last year, P recruited an army of prisoners from Russian penal colonies to fight on the frontlines in Ukraine. He enjoyed the notoriety, filming himself strutting around the battlefield and delivering P his only real victory in Bakhmut after months of war.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 08.22.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.22.23/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Aug 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.22.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We want to begin tonight with a 1-2 punch of extreme weather from Tropical storm Harold slamming Texas to the sweltering heat across the middle of the country. Thousands of homes and businesses are without power tonight after Tropical Storm Harold made landfall South of Corpus Christi with sustained winds of fifty miles per hour. The nineth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season is bringing heavy rains, flooding, strong winds and storm surge along the coast. Elsewhere, it’s dangerous. And excessive heat causing problems from Minnesota to Florida. More than one hundred and forty million Americans are under heat alerts in nearly half the states. Triple-digit feels like temperatures topped one hundred and ten degrees in places like Kansas City and Minneapolis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tropical storm Harold came ashore today with a vengeance packing wind gusts of more than sixty miles an hour. All around me, those Gulf waters continue to wash ashore, people were stranded and roads were flooded. Harold is pummeling parts of Texas. The storm unleashed wind gusts up to sixty miles an hour as it made landfall this morning unleashing torrents of rain on the Lone Star State. Governor G.A says Texas has deployed emergency responders to monitor the storm as it moves across the state. In the Midwest, the heat is the issue.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 08.21.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.21.23/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Aug 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.21.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We want to start tonight with violent storms and this summer packed with extreme weather and excessive heat. Tonight, we’re talking about tropical storm Hilary which slammed Southern California with record breaking rainfall strong winds and widespread floodwaters. This is the biggest storm, the strongest storm to hit the Golden State, in more than eight decades. Aerial footage shows the transformation from sunny deserts and palm trees to a wasteland of thick mud covering everything in sight. The mud several feet deep in some areas, water turning roads and interstates into rivers. Officials warn that the rains and flooding will continue as the storm moves north toward the Canadian border.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just imagine the force when it slammed into this building, ripping it right open. Tonight, neighborhoods buried in several inches of mud and residents left knee-deep in aggravation. Hilary packed a wallop for a region that last saw a tropical storm eighty-four years ago. Boulders tumbled. Across southern California, many tried to drive on flooded roads, some that turned into muck. This truck ended up half buried. Even rescuers needed to be rescued. Palm Springs normally gets about four and one and half inches of rain a year. It received nearly that much in one day. And so much standing water on roads that looked OK, this is what happened as cars tried to brake coming down interstate 5. And in the midst of one natural disaster, a 5.1 earthquake jolted the town of Ojai and was felt over a wide area. It was that kind of day.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 08.20.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.20.23/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Aug 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.20.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with some breaking news, Southern California has been rocked a 5.1 magnitude earthquake, the epic center in Ojai in Ventura County. It shook our Los Angeles newsroom. There have been several aftershocks, but no reports of damage or injuries at this time. This happening as millions of people there are bracing for a massive tropical storm, the worst of it expected later tonight. Hilary is bearing down and the impacts could be significant. Intense rains, lashing winds, flash flooding, even mudslides, all of it dangerous and potentially devastating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That earthquake packs a double whammy for those already hunkering down for Hilary. There was no tsunami warning. Meanwhile, the governors of California and Nevada has declared states of emergency as Hilary moves in. A warning to get out now for unhoused residents seeking shelter in an LA riverbed. Mountain and foothill communities under evacuation orders with flash flooding warnings across southern California as tropical storm Hilary moves in. East of Los Angeles, the three main roads into Palm Springs are closed, flights canceled, and a plea from the city’s mayor to stay inside as the community braces for a forecasted three inches of rain. Hilary made landfall today in Baja California, Mexico with heavy rain and high winds pummeling the region. The strength of this storm has worried residents in its path filling sandbags and stockpiling supplies. The dire warnings prompting officials to close state beaches and parks in Orange and San Diego counties, where navy ships and sailors were moved out to sea. National parks including Death Valley and Mojave Desert are also off-limit as the potential for catastrophic flooding intensifies.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 08.19.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.19.23/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Aug 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.19.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with hurricane Hilary, it’s expected to hit southern California tomorrow with more than forty million people in its path. The big storm is packing potentially devastating punch, prompting the first ever tropical storm watches in the west coast. Today people rushed to stock up on household essentials and sandbags to protect their homes. Storm preparations are underway here in Seal Beach where a mile-long berm has been constructed to protect homes. The focus, keeping people and property out of harm’s way. Lightning strikes light up San Diego, sounding the alarm for what’s predicted to come as Hilary speeds its way towards the southwest. The storm is barreling north from Beja towards Southern California, putting many communities at high risk of excessive rain as much as ten inches what the national hurricane center calls catastrophic flooding. To dodge Hilary, one dozen Navy carriers and ships are being moved out of San Diego’s ports. The storm already being felt in California’s Mojave Desert along with Phoenix and Nevada. Las Vegas could see a record shattering four inches of rain. The threat of heavy downpours has many concerned that Southern California’s hillsides weakened by the massive winter storms could give away. If Hilary does make a landfall, it will be the first major tropical storm to hit southern California since 1939 when ninety people were killed. President B says FEMA personnel and supplies are ready to respond if needed.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 08.18.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.18.23/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Aug 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.18.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with forty-two million people in the west bracing for hurricane Hilary. The massive and rare storm is heading directly toward the southwest. The effects of the storm are already being felt in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico with high winds and torrential downpours. Right now, people from San Diego to Los Angeles are preparing for the worst beginning over the weekend as southern California is under its first ever tropical storm watch. The storm packing triple-digit wind speeds is expected to weaken as it moves closer to land but could become the first tropical storm to make a landfall in California in more than eight decades. Forecasters say some areas of California and Nevada could see ten inches of rain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Southern California is taking advantage of the calm before the storm. Building berms to protect beach communities from high surf and swift water rescue teams are on standby. Flooding is a huge concern after relentless winter storms battered the Golden State earlier this year. Now, emergency managers are tracking Hilary trying to anticipate where resources will be needed most. When the storm hits, some areas could see up to ten inches of rain. Las Vegas usually gets a little more than four inches of rain in a year. If the storm continues on its path, it could get that amount in one weekend. The last tropical storm to hit southern California was back in 1939. It dumped more than five inches of rain in Los Angeles flooding communities and washing away homes, forty-five people died.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 08.17.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.17.23/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Aug 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.17.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight on Maui with new questions and growing anger on what could have been done to prevent the deadliest wildfire in the US in more than a century. The death toll is rising, and it’s possible. But more than a thousand people are still unaccounted for. Tonight, FEMA is telling CBSN that many people died in their homes and it may take years to identified all the remains. Officials say just forty percent of the impacted area has been searched. The state’s emergency management director remains defiant in face of questions including CBSN about why he didn’t use warning sirens to alert residents as the flames approached. Late this afternoon, Hawaii’s attorney general announced plans for a third-party private organization to review the performance of state and county agencies in preparation and response to the fires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight, as the death toll climbs to a hundred and eleven. FEMA officials tell me many of the victims have been found in their homes and in their beds. Many are likely children and had no idea the flames were approaching. And we now know that the sirens did work but in those critical hours were intentionally not used. This harrowing video shows people on Maui desperately seeking refuge in a pool as the inferno burned all around them during last week’s wildfires. And now, as FEMA crews continue the grueling search for victims, it’s becoming clear many were either unaware or had little chance to escape the fast-approaching flames. The fire that had been declared one hundred percent contained flared up again around 3:30 PM roadways into Lahaina were closed by then hurricane-force winds had knocked out power to much of the town. It was 5:15 PM nearly two hours after the flare up that the flames reached Front Street, according to witnesses who spoke with the New York Times. The whole time, the sirens were silent.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 08.16.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.16.23/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Aug 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.16.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We are just back from seeing the devastation of that wildfire Lahaina. And tonight, we are learning shocking details that reveal Maui residents aren’t just dealing with a monumental natural disaster but also a disastrous response. CBSN has learned that Maui’s Emergency Operations Chief had no disaster experience. Why does that matter? Because it’s his department that’s responsible for setting off the warning sirens. For the first time since the early hours of the tragedy, the main Lahaina road is now open, allowing residents to see what’s left. There are now at least forty cadaver dogs helping with the search going block after block of burnt-out homes and cars looking for the hundreds of people that are still unaccounted for. The White House announcing today that the president and first lady will travel to Maui on Monday to survey the destruction and meet with first responders and survivors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The town has reopened, and tonight thousands of people are returning home to scenes of devastation like this. But what many have also found is local emergency response that sources tell us have hampered the recovery effort. Tonight, with the death toll mounting, the road to recovery is long and painful. The county is under investigation for its response last week. Survivors say most residents were not evacuated and many of them waited days for help to arrive. And tonight, CBSN has learned Maui’s Emergency Operation Chief had no background in disaster response, getting the job over forty applicants according to Maui now. It’s estimated that it will cost more than five and a half billion dollars to rebuild Maui County. And for those who have lost their homes, now there is concern they will lose their ancestral land to predatorial developers. For now, paradise hangs by a thread as families still search for loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 08.15.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.15.23/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Aug 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.15.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We are live again tonight from Maui reporting from America’s fiftieth state, Hawaii, because it is grappling with the worst natural disaster in its history. Today marks one week since the wildfires tore through Lahaina, but the search and recovery for victims is just in the beginning stages. The death toll stands nearly one hundred but that number is expected to grow dramatically in the coming days. The National Guard and twenty cadaver dogs continue the painstaking search for victims in the burned-out ruins. The Maui Police Department revealing just tonight, that they have identified four victims it’s calling on family members with missing loved ones to give the DNA samples. Lahaina is the hardest hit community but right here in Hula, known as “upcountry”. Fires are still burning. Moments ago, we just witnessed crews putting out new hotspots. President B today making his first in-depths remarks about the tragedy, and promising to visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Lahaina still smolders, it’s a race to finish recovery efforts before forecasted rain, possibly hampering the search for remains. The historic town closed off, authorities warning about toxic hazards. Today, officials were only able to identified four people using their fingerprints, but we’re learning more tonight about victims found by their families. We witnessed the devastation first hand, traveling to Lahaina by boat with volunteers delivering supplies.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 08.14.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.14.23/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Aug 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.14.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The embers are not far from where we are tonight in Kula and there are still smoldering. Linemen are working to restore power. Today, more members of the National Guard were activated to help and this just in, the death toll on this Monday night now at ninety-nine. And Hawaii’s Governor tell CBSN that the number could rise dramatically by ten to twenty per day with hundreds still missing. Today, FEMA bringing in teams of cadaver dogs from the mainland. And it is still so hot here. The dogs take breaks to cool down before resuming this difficult and somber work. The scope of the damage is unimaginable. And there are reports tonight that fire hydrants ran out of water as crews raced to fight blaze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our visit to Lahaina, once home to thirteen thousand people now a desolate ruin. The scope of the damage unfathomable, with authorities searching for more than thirteen hundred people still missing. The recovery just beginning as twelve more cadaver dogs arrived to help home through the rubble. Hawaii Governor J.G describes the wildfire as a fire hurricane reaching temperatures of one thousand degrees fueled by over eighty miles per hour winds and tearing through more than two thousand buildings. And for many families, the waiting and the unknown is the worst part. We traveled with volunteers by fishing boat, bringing supplies to the hardest hit part of Lahaina. And the fire moved quickly, engulfing the town with no warning, as questions mount about why the eighty outdoor sirens stay silent. We are just learning from the Governor that the first eighty confirmed deaths in Lahaina were found in their cars or in the water.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 08.13.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.13.23/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Aug 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.13.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The death toll from the historic fire that roared through parts of the Hawaiian Island of Maui has risen again. More than ninety people confirmed killed. The inferno is now the deadliest US wildfire in more than a century. The scale of suffering and trauma only now coming into focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are just back now from a shelter still filled with a thousand people five days after that wildfire chewed through parts of west Maui. And many people here tell us they are still trying to comprehend the sheer scale of the devastation and to process the pain. The people in Hawaii are some of the toughest around, but even they need help, they certainly do. There is a search for everyday things like gasoline, phone reception, just a signal, or your next hot meal. Power outages are rolling it means that major appliances are all but useless. And residents say right now, it’s local volunteers and groups that have stepped up while the government has, so far anyway, that help, mostly words, not yet deeds. There’s also increasing frustration about the response to the fire threat, warnings that were never heard or never seen.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 08.12.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.12.23/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Aug 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.12.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, there is a desperate and intensifying search for the missing on Maui. Right now, they number nearly one thousand people. At least, eighty are confirmed dead with that number expected. Today, fire crews battled flames still burning from wildfires that ravaged parts of the island. Over the historic town of Lahaina, the scene is simply apocalypse. Most buildings, torched. Some still smoldering. The inferno destroyed much of the town, everything you see in red. And those who escaped the flames are sharing their stories of survival but also of confusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many are returning home today for the first time since this fire hit. And they will face absolute heartbreak. We’ve spent the past few days in town. We saw entire neighborhoods that were leveled. And of the homes that still stand, they overlook these fields of ash that search teams tonight are combing through looking for the missing. Anxiety and frustration as bumper-to-bumper traffic stretched miles on the reopened highway to Lahaina. Residents, who were allowed through, confronted devastation at the end of the road in what the governor calls the worst natural disaster in Hawaii’s history. Before Tuesday’s massive fire ripped through Lahaina, turning eighty percent of the town to ash there was a chaos and confusion. Emergency sirens were not activated. And those in town only fled when the flames were on their heels.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 08.10.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.10.23/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Aug 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.10.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with those catastrophic wildfires in Hawaii that are tearing a path through Maui, leaving behind widespread destruction. Late tonight, officials confirmed that the death toll has risen. We are awaiting an update on firefighting and recovery efforts, and will bring that to some of you when it happens. Fast moving flames turned this colorful, tropical paradise into black smoke, ash and soot. Take a look at this before and after photos from the city of Lahaina and its historic harbor, a vibrant neighborhood reduced to scorched earth. At least fifty-three people have been killed and an unknown number are missing. President B today approved a major disaster declaration for Hawaii. And county officials say the fire near Lahaina is eighty percent contained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Battling wildfires is an enormous job. But here on the island, there are only around a hundred firefighters responding to three different scenes. For context, in New York City, two hundred firefighters responded to a crane fire last week. And for that reason, the military has been brought in to assist with search and rescue and even civilians are helping out. Tonight, Hawaii is in a state of shock. And resources are stretched thin as firefighters battle three large wildfires burning in Maui. Hundreds of structures, mostly in the town of Lahaina, are already gone. Blue Hawaii Helicopters is delivering basic supplies to those who lost everything. We were there as they helped this family evacuate. Hurricane-force winds sent a wall of flames tearing across the island on Tuesday, giving residents little time to react. The coast guard rescued seventeen people who ran into the ocean to escape the flames in an apocalyptic scene. The death toll is expected to climb as block after block of Lahaina has been reduced to charred rubble. More than eleven thousand people, mostly tourists have already been evacuated. It’s a major below to Maui’s economy. Last year, tourism generated more than five and a half billion dollars in revenue, roughly eighty percent of total revenue.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 08.09.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.09.23/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Aug 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.09.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Now there is a breaking news, a Utah man was shot and killed earlier this morning during an FBI raid on his home. The agent was attempting to serve an arrest warrant after the man allegedly threatened to kill President B, his family, and several others, including former President Obama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to court filings just three days ago, C.R posted that he’d heard President B was coming to Utah. R made a threat, saying he would be cleaning the dust off the M24 sniper rifle. Video shot by neighbors apparently shows the FBI raid which began this morning and, at some point, explosions are seen. One neighbor said they heard six gunshots and the R’s body was eventually brought out to the street. Early Wednesday, sources tell CBSN an FBI team try to arrest R at his Provo, Utah home, less than an hour’s drive from where the President is traveling tonight. Some kind of confrontation ensued and R died. The FBI had been investigating R for five months for allegedly making threats against government officials. Among them, Manhattan District Attorney, New York Attorney General and Attorney General, all of them, overseeing criminal or civil proceedings against former president D.T. In March, using Truth Social, a platform favored by T. R said he would be traveling to New York to fulfil his dream of killing B. The criminal complaint includes allegations of more than two dozen other threats against Vice President H, prosecutors and FBI agents. Neighbors tell CBSN R was active in his church, Pro Second Amendment, and someone known to have a “Arsenal of weapons in his home”. The White House official says the president was briefed on this case this morning shortly after the shootout. The Secret Service referred all questions on the case to the FBI.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 08.08.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.08.23/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Aug 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.08.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, thousands of across the mid-Atlantic are picking up the pieces and assessing damage following a series of powerful storms overnight. At least two people were killed, one in Alabama and one in South Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight, a rain-wrapped tornado reported on the ground near the Colorado-Kansas border. Tornado sirens warn residents to seek shelter. Storm chasers have reported damage to buildings. Powerful storms also continue to pummel the Northeast today with a tornado knocking down trees as it swept through Mattapoisett, Massachusetts. Two days of raging storms caused flooding across the state, making some roads impassable. On Monday, from New York to Tennessee, the force of mother nature was evident. The storm brought down trees and knocked out power for thousands around Knoxville, Tennessee, eye-opening scenes everywhere. Frighten drivers in Westminster, Maryland were caught in a dangerous thunderstorm Monday as winds up to eighty miles per hour knocked down powerlines like dominoes. Nearly fifty people were rescued from their cars. The wild weather brought airports across the east coast to a standstill.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 08.07.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.07.23/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Aug 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.07.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with threats of severe weather from dangerous heat in the south to thunderstorms and possible tornadoes stretching from the Great Lakes to the east coast. Storms have already created havoc for air travelers with more than six thousand flights delayed and more than thirteen hundred canceled. Airports from Atlanta to New York experienced ground stops this afternoon, forcing the FAA to reroute flights around the storms. More than thirty million Americans in nearly a dozen states are under tornado watches from North Carolina to New York. In Tennessee, downed trees like these outside the city of Maryville have left tens of thousands without power. Meanwhile, in the south, unrelenting heat is scorching residents from coast to coast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The storm systems just blasted through reading, packing quite a punch with heavy rain, lightning and strong gusts of wind, which could reach up to seventy-five miles per hour as the system roars across the region. Ominous warnings of an approaching tornado sounded in Flatwoods, Kentucky today. Severe thunderstorms packing violent winds stretched across the south, ripping branches off trees in Tennessee. Downtown Parkersburg, West Virginia turned into a flood zone brought on by heavy afternoon rain. The storm system push through Midwest this weekend with reports of nearly a dozen tornadoes, including one in Christian County, Illinois, shredding roofs and damaging power lines. From California to Texas to Florida, about one hundred million are under heat alerts.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 08.06.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.06.23/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Aug 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.06.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, the legal battle between former President D.T and a federal prosecutor investigating the January 6th is nearing a showdown in court just as the Republican presidential race is heating up, and his own former Vice President is speaking out. T’s legal team has now been ordered to responded as soon as possible to the Justice Department which is seeking to restrain comments about the case made by T who has been raging against special counsel J.S both on the campaign trail and on social media. This weekend, T’s lawyers sought a delay, but Judge T.C denied that request and gave T a Monday deadline to respond. T pleaded not guilty this past week to criminal charges related to his alleged role in trying to overturn the 2020 election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahead of Monday’s standoff over what former President D.T can and can’t say about this case. T’s lawyer, J.L, argued that the former president said nothing wrong. Ahead of what could be a contentious courtroom battle, former President T slammed the indictment brought by special counsel, J.S. His legal team is planning to ask for a motion to dismiss the charges in the January 6th case. A new CBSN poll find just over a half of Americans believe T tried to stay in office illegally. Most Americans also believe the indictments against T are upholding the rule of law and defending democracy. At the same time a majority of those poll believe the investigations are aimed at stopping T’s 2024 campaign. And that number was even higher among Republicans. T’s grip on Republican party remains strong as he and his rivals campaign ahead of the first GOP debate which T might skip later this month, few of T’s rivals have been critical of him, but former New Jersey Governor, C.C came out swinging this weekend on CBSN Sunday morning.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 08.05.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.05.23/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Aug 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.05.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;An incendiary social media post by former President D.T has sparked a standoff between him and federal prosecutors after T broadly threatened revenge on Friday. Justice Department officials push back and asked the judge in the January 6th case to rein in T. This comes just days after T pleaded not guilty in federal court over his alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election. And tonight, after the judge gave T a deadline of 5 PM Monday to respond, there has been a flurry statements from both sides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The T legal team has responded, they’ve asked for three more days. But this is just one of many legal proceedings that the former president is facing as he tries to be the president yet again. Simultaneously facing three criminal prosecutions, the former president took the stage in Alabama last night undeterred. Also yesterday, government prosecutors for the 2020 election interference case asked a federal judge for a protective order to limit what T can say publicly about the proceedings. They cited concerns, T might share pretrial evidence and his history of making public statements regarding individuals involved in proceedings against him, including this Friday, all caps social media post “IF YOU GO AFTER ME, I’M COMING AFTER YOU!”. T has already directed his rhetoric at the special counsel heading the federal investigations. Republican rivals, long reluctant to anger the party’s pro-T base have been inching closer to criticism. In an interview today for Face the Nation, former Vice President M.P was asked if he would testify against his former commander in chief. And just a little while ago, special counsel J.S responded to that response asking the judge not to grant the delay, saying the government is ready to move forward. It’s the defendant who standing in the way.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 08.04.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.04.23/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Aug 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.04.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with chaotic weather across much of the nation from scorching heat to thunderstorms and heavy rain. Millions of Americans are under flood alerts tonight and flash flood emergencies were declared in parts of Kentucky and Tennessee this morning after torrential downpours dropped nearly a foot of rain in some areas. Entire neighborhoods are under water in Union City, Tennessee, where residents were rescued from their homes evacuated. In the rest of the South, it’s the heat making things dangerous for sixty-five million Americans. It’s been that way almost every day this summer in Arizona and Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight, severe weather slamming parts of the south. Nearly a foot of rain falling over twenty-four hours in northwest Tennessee, flash floods forcing emergency evacuations. This trailer parking community under waist-deep water, some two-dozen people rescued onto dry land. A frightening scene in Union City, Tennessee, video taken from a front porch showing the widespread high-water levels. Parts of Kentucky and Alabama soaked, too, leaving this roadway washed out. This comes as the record-breaking heat makes a comeback across the south and west. Millions of people from Texas to Arizona, under triple-digit excessive heat warnings as folks brace for the return of oppressive temperatures. The agency that manages Texas’s power grid has issued a watch for next week when we’re expecting more temperatures in the triple digits and demand to be up. Now, they say, so far, the power grid has hold up, even after setting seven new peak demand records, just this summer.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 08.03.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.03.23/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Aug 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.03.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with this historic moment in our nation’s history. For the first time in our country’s two hundred and forty-seven years, a former president of the United States has been arraigned on criminal charges of trying to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power. CBSN was inside the courtroom for the entire hearing, which lasted less than thirty minutes. A former president, in a blue suit and red tie appeared calm as he said aloud “not guilty”. Also, in court today, six DC federal judges sitting in the back row including one who said those who egged on January 6th rioters “stoked the flames of fear”. The four-count indictment details D.T’s alleged criminal plot to hold on to power and overturn the 2020 presidential election. Security was tight around the courthouse in DC just block from the US Capitol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was something Americans have never seen in before, a former president accused of trying to defraud the nation he once led and arriving back in Washington to a crowd gathered not at the White House but at a federal courthouse. Former President D.T took on his critics after he left his arraignment in Washington. He traveled to the federal courthouse under heavy security escorted by his Secret Service detail. Throngs of protesters and fans gathered outside. Once inside, he was processed, but no mugshot was taken. Inside, T was fingerprinted, in the courtroom, he raised his righthand to be sworn in. He stated his name and gave his age at 77. He pleaded not guilty to four charges, brough in a grand jury investigation being led by special counsel J.S, who was also in the courtroom. Three counts of conspiracy, one for obstruction for allegedly leading a criminal conspiracy to try to overthrow the 2020 presidential election. The judge told T the obstruction charge carries a maximum of twenty years in prison. The indictment says T deliberately disregarded the truth. Sources say T’s lawyers plan to argue that T’s false claims about the election were not criminal and that his efforts were driven by the advice of outside attorneys, like S.P, R.G and J.E among others. CBSN has learned that they are likely some of the six alleged coconspirators cited in the indictment. The judge scheduled the next hearing for August 28th. The special counsel has called for a speedy trail. But sources close to T’s legal team say they will push for a delay, arguing they need time to navigate the many cases facing T.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 08.02.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.02.23/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Aug 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.02.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We are now less than twenty-four hours away from an unprecedented moment in American history, where a former president returns here to the nation’s capital to make his first appearance on charges of going after the bedrock of American democracy, a peaceful transfer of power. D.T is no stranger to the inside of a courthouse. This is his third indictment. These are the first charges to stand from actions T allegedly took while in office all in an attempt, according to special counsel to remain in power. The special counsel, J.S, called the January 6th attack an assault on the seat of American democracy that fueled by lies. T’s lawyers today claim the charges violate the former president’s First Amendment rights. But central to the indictment are contemporaneous notes from former Vice President M.P. And today, he lashed out at his former boss saying T was surrounded by “crackpot lawyers”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahead of T’s arrival in Washington tomorrow, his lawyers are moving fast to build the defense. His former vice president is emerging as both a key witness and a key critic. And security officials are already on edge. Former President D.T spends the morning playing golf at his club in Bedminster, New Jersey as he and his lawyers brace for a high-stakes appearance in federal court. The sweeping indictment alleged T used dishonesty, fraud and deceit to try to overturn the legitimate results of the 2020 election by organizing slates of fraudulent electors in seven states that he lost, pushing officials like the Georgia Secretary of State. And pressuring then Vice President M.P to refuse to certify the election results. Sources say T’s lawyer plan to argue that T’s false claims about the election were criminal and that his efforts were driven by the advice of outside attorneys like S.P, R.G and J.E among others. CBSN has learned that they’re likely some of the six unindicted coconspirators referenced in the indictment.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 08.01.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.01.23/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Aug 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.01.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin with breaking news in one of the special counsel investigations of D.T. A federal grand jury here in Washington has voted to indictment the former president for his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. Among the charges include conspiracy to defraud the United States, obstruct an official proceeding and a civil rights-era law that makes it a crime to oppress threaten, or intimidate a person of their free exercise or enjoyment of any right in the constitution. It is just the second time in American history that the Department of Justice has filed criminal charges against a current or former US president. Special counsel J.S announced the indictment just moments ago. Today’s charges are related to T’s attempts to challenge the result of election he lost, plans for fake electors, and his role in the January 6th attack on the US Capitol. T responded today’s news on his social media account calling S deranged and the indictment election interference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An historic day, with the former president in the current Republican front runner, D.T, being accused by the Justice Department of spearheading a criminal conspiracy against the United States. According to the indictment, for more than two months following election day, the defendant spread lies that there was fraud in the election and he actually won. These claims were false, and the defendant knew that they were false. The former president was also charged with impeding the January 6th congressional proceeding, where the 2020 election outcome was to be verified and led to the storming of the Capitol by T’s supporters. The indictment lists six unnamed co-conspirators. The actions described possibly match the conduct of former T attorney R.G, lawyer J.E and a former Justice Department official. The indictment also says T and some of the co-conspirators attempted to reach Senators late on January 6th to ask them to delay the certification vote even more so they can get states to object the count. Sources tell CBSN former President T’s legal team is now mapping out a new strategy to push back on the charges, shifting blames onto lawyers who were advising him at the time of the aftermath of the 2020 election. In a recent social media post, T noted his attorneys met with the Department of Justice, saying they explain in detail that I did nothing wrong and was advised by many lawyers. Sources say the strategy could involve trying to pin blame on J.E, T’s former lawyer who sought to have former Vice President M.P refuse to certify the 2020 election result and presented T a memo outlining a plan to do so. But those familiar with the special counsel’s works say T’s conduct is being deeply investigated and that prosecutors are skeptical that T was just following advice. The next step in this process will come on Thursday, when former President D.T has been summoned to appear in Washington, before the grand jury in the court.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 07.31.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.31.23/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Aug 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.31.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We want to begin tonight with breaking news of a potential mass shooting that was prevented at a Jewish school in Memphis. The Memphis police say as the suspect attempted to gain entry into Hebrew Academy. When he couldn’t get in the building, he opened fire. Police are hailing to school for a safety plan saying that prevented anyone from being harmed. The suspect fled the scene and was later shot by police during a traffic stop. The congressman who represents the area called this quote “an apparent act of violent antisemitism”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memphis police just afternoon today, this man attempted to enter Hebrew Academy carrying a gun. They say when he failed to get inside, he fired shots outside the school and fled. The school provide police with a photo of the suspect and description of the vehicle he was driving, a maroon pickup truck with California plates. Police quickly spotted the vehicle and pulled him over. Monday shooting comes four months after shooter killed six people, including three nine-year-old children in Nashville. That tragedy sparks scrutiny of Tennessee’s lacks gun laws and the new calls to strengthen security at both private and public schools. The police say the incident could have acted more tragically but the school have safety measures in place including stopping a suspect from entering the building. They also say it’s too early to say whether this was a hate crime.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 07.30.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.30.23/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Jul 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.30.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin once again with historic heat wave that has really gripped much of the country throughout July. Well, tonight, some good news. Triple-digit temperatures that have scorched the southwest are expected to ease this week. But not just yet, today, Phoenix in Arizona had its thirty-first consecutive day of the Mercury topping one hundred ten degrees. In the northeast, a storm broke the heat that, but it was fierce. Despite hurricane force winds, this guard at the Tombs of the Unknowns at the Arlington National Cemetery never broke stride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;July is on the brink of breaking a world weather record from punishing heat that has gripped much of the nation. A dangerous heat dome punishing the nation, the last week of July testing the mettle of millions. This raging wildfire jumped international lines from Washington State to British Columbia. So far, hundreds of fires across Canada have burned a land mass the size of Cuba. People across the US are dialing 911 for help. CDC’s heat and health tracker shows the most ER visits last week were in the west followed by the southwest and the Florida panhandle. Fire hydrants offering small consolation for New Yorkers while others seek relief at the city’s five hundred cooling centers. Animals, too, getting help. At the LA zoo, chimps chomp on meat pops under misters, while Meerkats munch on ice cubes. And otters, they stay in the water, feasting on frozen fish. All strategies to keep the animals safe with zookeepers looking for signs of distress. So, zookeepers add, the same signs can be looked out for your pets as well. If they start to appear lethargic, or they are not drinking water, get them help. The heat might be too much for them as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 07.29.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.29.23/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Jul 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.29.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Sweltering, scorching, sizzling, there are many ways to say it is hot. And millions of Americans are once again this weekend feel it. But there is relief in sight, including in the steamy southwest where the heat has been historic, punishing and deadly. Tonight, more than a hundred million Americans in at least twenty states remain under heat alerts and advisories from coast to coast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a humid, sweltering evening, it has been over ninety most of the day, where the heat-index, it’s closer to a hundred. The northeast getting scorched this weekend capping off the hottest July ever recorded. When it is this hot, access to cooling isn’t just about comfort. It can be a matter of life and death. As New Yorkers try to get cool off, power grids are at risk of overheating too. The city’s utility company Com Edison is warning people to use their AC’s only as much as needed. Temperatures are so hot in Tucson, Arizona even cacti are dying. Phoenix has spent nearly a month enduring temperatures over a hundred and ten degrees. Wild weather in the Midwest as people spotted near Iowa Falls. A heat-related tragedy in late Lake station Indianna Humane Society officials say as many as ten policy dogs were killed when the AC failed in the truck they were being transported in. In Minnesota, the lack of rain has been devastating for farmers. The heat brought his unwelcome visitor to a woman’s home in Burbank, California. He thought he would cool off in her pool before taking a nap in a tree. In New York, tourists hoping to enjoy a summer sightseeing cruise are now questioning their decisions.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 07.28.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.28.23/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Jul 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.28.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, D.T makes his first campaign appearance since the new charges. The former president holds a dominant lead in the race for the Republican nomination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former President D.T leads the Republican presidential field by as much as thirty points in some polls. His sustained popularity, despite the legal challenges, is why opponents closest him avoid directly criticizing his alleged misconduct. In an interview with CBSN, Florida Governor R.D wouldn’t do it. But today, D says he disagree with T on issues like border security and spending. Now in third place, South Carolina Senator T.S also avoids attacking T. The Senator is sneaking up in the polls and is now taking on D. over Florida’s new Black History curriculum standards. The new guideline say Florida middle schoolers should be taught about the harsh conditions enslaved people endured, and about how slaves develop skills which, in some instances, could be applied for their personal benefit.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 07.27.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.27.23/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Jul 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.27.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;And we begin tonight with breaking news in the investigation of former President D.T’s alleged mishandling of classified documents after leaving office. The former president is facing new charges including allegations of obstruction of justice of the willful retention of national defense information. This brings the total number of charges to forty in the first ever indictment of a former president. Plus, a third defendant has been named in the case. He is being described as a Mar-a-Lago employee who helped move some of the boxes containing classified materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight, a sudden flurry of developments at the Justice Department. Late today, a third person was named as a defendant in the Mar-a-Lago documents case. And these new charges and details put the former president in further legal peril. C.D.O, a worker at the property was accused of attempting to delete security footage. T was also charged with new counts, including an additional count of retaining more classified documents. CBSN has identified that the document was related to Iran and national security, which T was alleged to have shown to aides. The documents also allege former President T worked with his co-defendants to try to pressure an unnamed employee to delete security footage at Mar-a-Lago. The trial in Florida is scheduled for next year. The defendant, who was named today, is scheduled to appear in court on July 31, and then on the separate January 6th investigation. Two sources close to T’s legal team say his top attorneys met with Special Counsel J.S’s office today and pepper Justice Department officials with their questions about the recent letters sent to T, which signaled he might be indicted. And while the grand jury met today, CBS had learned that no indictments have been returned as of yet, leaving the timing unclear. T wrote his attorneys had a productive meeting with the DOJ. The Special Counsel continues to interview witnesses about the sprawling efforts by T and his allies to prevent the certification of President B’s victory. The target letter outlined three federal statutes: conspiracy to commit an offense or defraud the United States, a law indicating potential charges that range from obstruction of an official proceeding to tampering with a witness and a law that deals with depriving someone of civil rights.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 07.26.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.26.23/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Jul 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.26.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with the stunning collapse of the proposed plea agreement between H.B and the Department of the Justice. The federal judge overseeing the case put the deal on hold after raising concerns about the stall agreement forcing the president’s son to plea not guilty to ??? tax crimes. Prosecutors and defense attorneys dismount together and provide the judge with additional information prior to ??? whether to approve. Today’s court hearing follows a five-year federal investigation led by a D.T appointed US attorney. Republicans blast the original plea as a slap on the risk and accuse justice of interfering of the investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was inside the court room by twenty feet from the president’s son. This is an extraordinary hearing unfolded. The deal falls apart and H.B appeared increasingly upset. This morning as H.B entered the Delaware Federal Court; his team carried a sense of optimism. plea deal will bring legal trouble into an end. But Judge M.O, a T appointee said she need more information before she could accept or reject the deal on this ??? tax charges and the gun violation, telling the court she felt she was being asked ??? to agreement she has concerns. The hearing late bear a critical disagreement between US attorney D.W, a T appointee and H.B’s legal team over whether the plea would close the door on future charges for other possible crimes. The probe is ongoing. The judge also had constitutional questions on how the gun charge will be handled. In the plea agreement, the charge would be dismissed if B remain drug-free and commits no additional crimes for two years. H.B left court and did not comment to reporters as originally planned.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 07.25.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.25.23/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Jul 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.25.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with dangerous weather from coast to coast from brutal heat to severe storms. A line of thunderstorms from New York to here in DC across hundreds of flight delays and cancellations. The damage tonight as dark storm clouds rolled in New York City, prompting flash flood alerts. And look at this, heavy rains pouring into the subway during the afternoon commute. It also brought down trees in parts of Brooklyn. And from coast to coast that dangerous heat dome is expanding and growing more intense from Montana to Miami. Two thirds of the nation will experience temperatures above ninety degrees within the next twenty-four hours. The most brutal conditions are in the southwest with the city of Phoenix topping one hundred and ten for twenty sixth straight day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The numbers are astounding. The impact is heartbreaking. Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix, is already confirmed eighteen heat-related deaths this year and is investigating six-nine others. The heat wave is now expanding into Midwest, temperatures in most of the region will above ninety. And wildfire smoke from Canada is once again making air quality unhealthful. Meanwhile, in Europe, temperatures continue to soar. In Greece, an ongoing fire fight. And on the Island of Evia, a plane has just dropped water onto flames, then crashed into the hillside, bursting into flames killing both airmen. Back in Phoenix as the concrete bakes, the concern grows over an effect known as the urban heat island. So much concrete and asphalt absorbing and retaining heat, it prevents the city from cooling overnight. And it has gotten worse overtime. In July of 1993, the average of low temperature was eighty-one degrees. Ten years later, it was eighty-seven. This July, it is ninety-one. There is race to cool down rescue animals, many treated for burned paws. The heat is particularly hard on the elderly and nearly ten thousand in Maricopa County without homes.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 07.24.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.24.23/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jul 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.24.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with a showdown between a federal government and Texas over the southern border. The Department of Justice has sued governor G.A after the state refused to remove large rolling buoys in the Rio Grande, installed in an effort to block migrants from crossing. The federal government says the barriers are dangerous and unlawful, while the government said he had a right to defend his state’s border. Last week, an internal complaint from a state trooper, obtained by CBSN, called the state’s response, quote “inhumane”, the trooper claimed he and other law enforcement officers were told to push migrants back into the water. He called the buoys a trap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the buoys in question here along the Rio Grande. And though, it appears they are not going anywhere, despite the threat from the Justice Department. This one is very likely headed to court. It’s a proverbial line in the sand, this one floating in the middle of the Rio Grande. Texas governor G.A and the B administration at a standoff, at a barrier meant to keep migrants out. The Department of Justice gave Texas until 1:00 PM central to agree to remove the buoys. G.A says “Texas will see you in court, Mr. President”. “This floating barrier poses threats to navigation and public safety and presents humanitarian concerns.” The stretch only one thousand feet along the state’s twelve-hundred-mile border. Anchored to the river bottom, the buoys roll if someone tries to climb over them. Along with newly erected razor fencing along the shoreline, it’s part of a multi-billion-dollar state effort to deter illegal immigration. But migrants have reportedly become tangled in the wire and suffered injuries.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 07.23.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.23.23/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jul 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.23.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with more hot weather. Temperatures are setting records across this country and around the world. A top NASA scientist warns July could become the Earth’s hottest month in hundreds, if not thousands of years. Tens of millions of Americans from California to Florida are struggling right now to endure these dangerous and sometimes deadly conditions. And as if things couldn’t get worse, the heat wave is forecast to expand into the Midwest and Northern plains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many in Los Angeles are using umbrellas to shield themselves from the brutal sun. But there is no relief in sight for these dangerous triple-digit temperatures. In Phoenix, first responders raced to save lives as the city is expected to hit its twenty-four straight days of temperatures of one hundred and ten degrees. The nights are just as brutal, not dipping below ninety. Nationwide, extreme heat kills more than seven hundred every year. And for paramedics working those 911 calls, the priority is cooling people down with icy cold IVs, wet towels, and ice packs. July is shattering heat records, more than thirty-five hundred so far. Cities, including Las Vegas, Austin and Miami are on a streak of dangerous temperatures. In Texas, parents smashed a car windshield to rescue their baby accidentally locked inside.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 07.22.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.22.23/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jul 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.22.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;It is another weekend of searing heat for tens of millions of Americans. The US has seen more than twelve thousand record-high temperatures so far this year, and it is dangerous. Forecasters warned the heat that is sweeping across large parts of the country for more than a month wont’ loosen its grip anytime soon. Instead, the heat dome is expanding increasing in size and intensity. The northern plains and Midwest are set to roast next. ER visits are up here in California and across the country as medical workers treat thousands of people this week for heat-related illnesses. Among those, firefighters and paramedics who are also struggling in these triple-digit temperatures. Crews are battling flames across the west as July could be the hottest month on record. The blistering heat dome is fueling a massive wildfire in southern Washington state that has already burned more than thirty thousand acres. The extreme weather causing deaths in several states including Arizona, Ohio, Florida and Pennsylvania where authorities recovered the body of two-year-old M.S. Her nine-month-old brother C is still missing. Six people died in the flash flooding there one week ago. Scientists say global warming is driving this unprecedented weather gripping the US, Asia and Europe. Greece is sweltering through the hottest weekend in fifty years. Triple-digit temperatures sparking wildfires with tourists being evacuated by boat from roads and closing the Acropolis. In Italy, a tornado and hail and lighting and high winds battered the Balkans. Back in California, more extremes snow cleanup. Today, the Tioga Pass, a major mountain highway, Yosemite National Park finally reopened to tourists, but the rest of the state still suffering under sizzling temperatures that will roll into August. Experts say the heat is so intense across the nation, it could send two hundred and thirty-five thousand people to emergency room this summer.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 07.21.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.21.23/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Jul 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.21.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with nearly one hundred and twenty million Americans under heat alerts. This duration of six straight weeks of intense heat is record breaking and there is no relief in sight. The city of Phoenix, nicknamed the Valley of the Sun, is starting to feel like it. Phoenix topped one hundred and ten degrees for the twenty second straight day today, a new record. Extreme Heat causes more death each year than any other weather event. And health officials from California to Florida are seeing a surge in heat related visits to emergency rooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, it is one hundred and eighteen degrees here in Palm Springs. It makes simply going outside down right dangerous for some people. And for some first responders, it’s an occupational hazard. Imagine, firefighters in this heat, wearing all that gear. For firefighters and EMTs in Palm Springs, the nonstop sweltering heat makes an already difficult job even more challenging. Battalion Chief G.L says with street temperatures that high, many calls can end up with a trip to the burn unit. It’s another blazing hot day in Phoenix, the city’s fifth consecutive day above one hundred and fifteen degrees. Rescue teams are heading to the streets to help the vulnerable, homeless population. In fact, it was so hot in Phoenix yesterday, a fire caused propane tanks to explode and fly into the air near Sky Harbor Airport. And in Southern Florida, the heat and humidity are pushing outdoor workers to the limit. The hot weather contributed to the death of a twenty-nine-year-old farm worker in Homestead.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 07.20.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.20.23/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jul 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.20.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with stunning new details in the Gilgo Beach murders on New York’s Long Island.

Police are trying to determine if the suspect, fifty-nine-year-old R.H is connected to any additional unsolved murders, including a wave of killings in Atlantic City in 2006. Now that investigators have his DNA in a statewide database other law enforcement agency can run his information against open cases. Last Friday, H was charged in the murders of three women and is the prime suspect in the death of fourth. He pleaded not guilty in all charges. Investigators are combing through his Massapequa Park home inch by inch for evidence. Police in New York are now in possession of an SUV from South Carolina that may be connected to at least one of the murders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight, the investigation into the Gilgo Beach murders spread nationwide. CBSN has learned police are looking into whether one or more of the three murders R.H charged with maybe have taken place inside the Long Island home he shared with his wife and children. His family was apparently away at the time of those murders. Law enforcement officials also tell CBSN investigators are looking to see if H is connected to other unsolved murders throughout the country. Suffolk County officials have executed several warrants including in South Carolina and Las Vegas with the alleged killer had ties. Police in South Carolina are looking into whether a 2014 missing person case could be tied to H as well. Long Island investigators are actively working with Atlantic City Police to determine if H is involved in a string of unsolved killings of young women.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 07.19.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.19.23/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jul 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.19.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with dangerous weather griping the nation from brutally hot temperatures to life-threatening flooding and even tornadoes. This afternoon, a large twister touch-down in Rocky Mount, North Carolina, causing significant damage about fifty miles east of Raleigh. Roofs were ripped off home and trees and powerlines were scattered across roadways. Several people were transported to the hospital. And then from coast to coast, from Pasadena to Palm Beach, we’re talking about one hundred and twenty million Americans who are now under heat alerts. And torrential rains have flooded entire towns in western Kentucky, turning roads into rivers and forcing residents from their homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The storm’s fury leaving a debris trail by some estimates, stretching two and a half miles wide. The tornado ripped through Pfizer manufacturing plant, shearing off the roof. In Dorchester, North Carolina, residential and ruined in stretches. Neighboring Kentucky worries, flooding.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 07.18.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.18.23/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jul 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.18.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We want to begin with extraordinary news that the former President of the United States D.T is facing another potential federal indictment. We learned today that T got a warning in the form of a target, informing him that he is the target of the investigation for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results. And that letter offers the former president a chance to testify before the federal grand jury that is meeting right here in Washington DC. And this criminal case comes amid an election season that is already heating up. Sources tell CBSN that it was hours ago that T called House Speaker K.M to try and talk about strategy on how to defend the president. It was just last month T became the first president in American history, current or former, to be criminally charged by the Department of Justice. And that was for his alleged mishandling of classified documents. The historic nature of today cannot be overstated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the second time in just two months, former President D.T receiving a target letter from Special Counsel J.M, signaling a possible indictment, this time, about the aftermath of the 2020 election. The former president confirmed the development on social media, lashing out at the special counsel, calling him deranged, revealing he was given four days to report to a grand Jury, saying an arrest and indictment were expected. Although it was unclear which specific charges T could face, his refusal to concede the 2020 election, false claims of election denial, and push for allies to fight to keep him in office, including on January 6 are well documented. Witnesses from T’s inner circle have testified and T applied pressure to a sprawling group of stakeholders, as he fought to stay in power, including his own vice president, state election officials, members of Congress and leaders at the Justice Department. The question now is whether T’s latest problem create an opening for his trailing Republican rivals.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 07.17.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.17.23/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jul 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.17.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, we begin with the urgent search for two missing children swept away during deadly flash flooding. Police have tripled their resources with teams on foot, in boats, using drones, divers, and sonar technology. Two-year-old M and nine-month-old C were on their way to a summer barbeque with their family when the storm turned deadly and water got into their car. Their young mother, thirty-two-year-old K killed trying to save her babies. Heavy downpours caused flooding across much of the northeast including Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, New York and New Jersey where the governor declared a state of emergency on Sunday. And the threat isn’t over. The region is bracing for more rain and flash flooding in the days ahead. Rain isn’t the only dangerous weather that’s out there. There’s that brutal heat in the west and the south. And the smoke from those wildfires in Canada, it is back, bringing unhealthy air to more than half of the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just moments ago, the coroner released her findings. Five people here dead from accidental drowning following those violent flash floods. A frantic search continues tonight in Bucks County, Pennsylvania after rushing flash floods turned roads into rapids. The vehicle of the Sheils’s family was overcome by floodwaters and in a moment of terror, the family abandoned the vehicle. The husband, four-year-old son, and grandmother survived, but the body of mother K.S was found by search team yesterday, while two-year-old M and nine-month-old C are still missing. Drones and search dogs are still looking for the children. Thirty miles away, the weather is being blamed for this forty-car freight train tumbling off the tracks in Whitemarsh Township. No one was injured. Air travel was also impacted, near four thousand flights were canceled over the weekend leaving angry passengers stranded. The heavy rainfall and flash flooding extended into parts of New York and New England. In Massachusetts, officials say a tornado touched down in North Brookfield Sunday. And video captured the moment rushing water crumpled this roadway in New Hampshire. Torrential rain closed about one hundred roads in the state.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 07.16.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.16.23/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Jul 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.16.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We’ve got coast to coast weather worries to talk about tonight. And here’s the latest, the worse first. In the northeast, deadly flash flooding swamped parts of Pennsylvania and New England. Today, these storms also forced ground stops at northeast airports. More than six thousand flights delayed, more than fourteen hundred canceled. Out west, this is day thirty-one, you’ve heard right, of dangerous heat. More than forty record highs are expected to fall today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California’s power grid is being put to the test by these brutal triple-digit temperatures stifling much of the state. While it’s hot and dry here, the east coast is getting slammed by summer storms. Mother nature’s powerful one-two punch, a dangerous heat dome stretching from south to west and torrential rains in the east. Flash flooding in Pennsylvania left five dead and two missing. Millions of Americans across ten states are under a flood alert. New York’s Governor C.H is pleading with residents to stay inside. H says recent summer storms have already caused about fifty million dollars in damage. It’s not rain, but blistering heat causing misery from Texas to California. Austin expected to hit one hundred seven on Monday, a new record. Phoenix now in its third week of temperatures a hundred ten or above, upping the danger of heat stroke and severe burns, especially on playground. In southern California, punishing triple-digit temperatures in dry conditions sparked multiple fires, burning thousands of acres and putting communities on alert for re-evacuations. Many in the Golden State are sweltering and trying to stay safe. Health experts are urging people to stay indoors, drink plenty of water, and if you do go outside, wear a light-colored clothing, because heat-stroke can hit quickly and often without warning.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 07.15.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.15.23/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Jul 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.15.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, much of America is baking. A heat that won’t quit. And today begins the second month of extreme temperatures now stretching from Washington to Texas to parts of Florida. And today, at least a dozen new record highs reported, that potentially-deadly heat stifling California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here at the beach is one of the few places in California where temperatures are in the 70s. But across most of the country, the extreme heat is unbearable. And as the heat dome expands, so does the danger. Along Southern California’s beaches, an escape from blistering triple-digit temperatures. The west is in the grip of a deadly, record-breaking heatwave. Death Valley is one of the hottest places on the planet and could hit a record one hundred and thirty degrees but that isn’t scaring away visitors. El Paso, Texas, on a thirty-day streak of temperatures spiking above one hundred. Nationwide, about twenty-seven million people will be suffering 110-degree temperatures through next week. The heat and dry brush that grew out of heavy rainy season are fueling wildfires in southern California. Four thousand acres are burning here in Riverside County. Firefighters are warning that it’s likely to get worse as the summer rolls on, a reality people from coast to coast will now have to live with.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 07.14.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.14.23/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Jul 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.14.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with the stunning new details we’re learning about a suspected serial killer on New York’s Long Island. The suspect is fifty-nine-year-old R.H charged with murders of three women and the prime suspect in the death of the fourth. The Manhattan architect and married father is a long-time resident of Long Island and lives not far from Gilgo Beach where the remains of his alleged victims were discovered in 2010. Well, that community has lived in fear for nearly thirteen years since officials first discovered those victims in total eleven sets of human remains were found in that same area. Authorities were unable to identify a suspect. And according to a new court document, investigators were able to link the suspect to the three killings using DNA evidence from a pizza crust and data from burner cell phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Police uncovered most of the human remains along this remote beach. Police say the suspect, R.H has been surveillance for months. And it was revealed in court documents today he alleged used one of the victims’ cellphones to make taunting calls to her family after the murder. Police say R.H, a New York architect is the suspected serial killer they’ve been hunting for over a decade. H. lived on this quiet street in Massapequa, Long Island. He was arrested near his Manhattan officer last night and arraigned today. Prosecutors said investigators were led to H. initially after a witness reported seeing a pickup truck when one of the victims disappeared in 2010. Investigators later recovered his DNA from a pizza crust discarded in Manhattan and matched it to genetic material found on the bodies. They also linked him on other evidence including burner phones that used to arrange meetings with the victims. Today H. was charged with murder in the deaths of three women and the prime suspect of another victim whose body was first discovered on Long Island in 2010. The women, all sex workers, were found wrapped in burlap bags.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 07.13.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.13.23/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Jul 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.13.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin with a major expansion with women’s healthcare in the United States. Federal health officials today approved first-ever over-the-counter birth control pill. The FDA decision means the drug Opill will soon be made available to millions of Americans without a prescription. Women’s health advocates are hailing today’s news as an important step in reproductive rights in the wake of last year’s Supreme Court decision that overturned R.V.W. More than half the country has banned or limited abortion access since the Supreme Court ruling. Opill will become the most effective birth control method available over the counter. Currently, an estimated ten million women in the US use prescription birth control pills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is unprecedented and it is the game changer for reproductive healthcare. The easier access is likely to have the biggest impact on tens of millions of teen girls and lower income women who may not have a doctor. The daily pill called Opill, which has been available in this country by prescription for fifty years, could be on store shelves without a prescription by early next year. More than three quarter of US women under age fifty in recent survey said they wanted birth control pills available without a prescription if deemed safe and effective. They’re already available over-the-counter in more than one hundred countries. The move was opposed by the Catholic Medical Association. The approval comes as the increased focus on birth control since last year’s overturning of R.V.W. The FDA reports, of the more than six million pregnancies in the US each year, almost half are unintended. Opill contains the hormone progestin and must be taken at the same time every day to be effective. Common side effects irregular bleeding, headaches, dizziness, and nausea, as with many birth control pills. French drug maker Perrigo hasn’t announced a price for the pills, which are sold in 28-day packs, but says it will make them affordable and provide Opill at no cost to those can’t pay.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 07.12.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.12.23/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Jul 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.12.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin with dangerous warnings as a heat dome blankets much of the nation with more extreme weather on the way. More than one hundred million Americans are under heat alerts with triple digit feels-like temperatures in sixteen states. Those brutal conditions are in the south and west with Arizona, the hotspot for record-breaking heart, approaching one hundred and twenty degrees. Even for a state that’s used to high temps, the ongoing stretch of scorching heat is posing a serious health risk. The National Weather Service says heat is the top weather-related killer each year. And in the northeast, Vermont remains in a state of emergency with officials just beginning to assess the damage from those historic floods. More storms are forecast across the region, including for areas that have already seen two months of rain in just two days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For thirteen straight days, the temperature here in Phoenix area have hit at least one hundred and ten degrees. The record is eighteen straight days. That was set in 1974. And that record is in jeopardy after another day of triple digits. As searing heat continues to cook the Phoenix area, this Salvation Army respite center offers a break from the baking temperatures. The cooling center is one of more than two hundred in Phoenix area where people can rest in the AC, take a cool shower or grab a cold water. Warning signs of heat stroke include dizziness, nausea and confusion. Southern California will share the misery starting Friday as temperatures are forecasted up to one hundred and thirteen degrees over LA county. While parts of the west cope with heat, swaths of the northeast are disaster zone after heavy rain and catastrophic flooding.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 07.11.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.11.23/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jul 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.11.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin with record-breaking weather. The catastrophic flooding impacting communities across Vermont as the northeast braces for more storms. The worst flooding in nearly one hundred years has cut off entire communities and caused tens of millions of dollars in damage, with homes, cars and roads even railroads tracks washed away. President B approved an emergency declaration to help coordinate relief efforts. And from California to Florida nearly ninety million Americans are under heat alerts. In Phoenix, Arizona the temperature has topped one hundred and ten degrees everyday this month. And it’s expected to reach nearly one twenty by the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see behind me, a good portion of downtown Montpelier is still under water tonight with the extreme flooding. Officials are worried the water is contaminated and have enacted a boil water notice. More than six inches of rain in two days caused widespread flooding, leaving few areas untouched. A.M, co-owner of Sam’s Steakhouse, showed us as he went back for the first time since the storm. Ring camera video captured the restaurant kitchen filling with water overtaking equipment. Now, the two-year-old restaurant is an absolute mess. Nearly the whole town needs rebuilding. The damage is extensive, take a look at this, a railroad track dangling at least sixty feet in the air, after the storm washed the ground away. Out west in Phoenix, Arizona, it’s a different kind of misery. A heat dome has settled in, and people are just trying to cope.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 07.10.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.10.23/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jul 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.10.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We want to begin tonight with historic flash flooding and an ongoing threat of heavy rain. And entire summer’s worth of rain fell in matter of a few hours in New York on Sunday. And now that same system is moving over New England. Torrential downpours are now pounding Vermont where governor P.S called for an all-hands-on-deck approach to the storms. The National Weather Service has issued its first high risk warning for the state since 2011. In New York, Hudson Valley flood waters caused at least one dead, washed away roads and forced the evacuation of homes and businesses. Twelve million residents across the New England are under flash flood alerts tonight with heavy rains expected through tomorrow morning. New York governor also said that the historic flooding seen in this part of the Hudson Valley is now part of life of people in this part of the country. And so, they need to remain vigilant especially considering it has turned deadly after one woman passed away trying to save her dog. Tonight, a state of emergency in Vermont with life threatening flooding, up to eight inches of rain fell today turning scenic landscape into deadly rivers in Vermont. Nearly the entire state was under flash flood warning. Fourteen swift rescue crews from as far away as North Carolina saved nearly two dozen people from cars, trees and homes. Now dozens of roads are crumpled and impassable. The deluge reminding some tropical storms Irene when eight inches of rain fell in less than a day. New York’s Hudson Valley was slammed.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 07.09.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.09.23/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jul 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.09.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin with the phrase, heated exchanges. It’s a diplomatic term that conveys hard choices and big stakes. President B will wrestle with both at the NATO’s summit this week as he hopes to maintain European unity as Russia’s war against Ukraine crosses the five-hundred-day mark. It was a also a theme of Treasury Secretary J.Y’s effort to clarify and calm US competition with China. But that phrase heated exchanges also applies to worrisome global weather patterns and their spin-off facts here at home, scorching temperatures and dangerous flooding. Oklahoma saw flooding that required several swift water rescues, and the week ahead could be among the hottest America has ever seen, all of this on the president’s plate as he arrives in London.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President B did not attend King C’s coronation back in May. But he promised that the two would see each other soon. Their visit tomorrow is just one of several high-profile events on the trip that will likely shape the future of NATO. Tonight, President B arrived in London ahead of Monday meeting with King C and the British Prime Minister when the leaders will talk climate change. But it&amp;rsquo;s the Russian invasion in the state of NATO that will dominate the president’s European trip. The world’s biggest security alliance is grappling with if and when Ukraine should join. The president suggested that the war must end before Ukraine is admitted. Pointing to a NATO agreement that all members would engage in the defense of any one ally that is under attack. To help Ukraine fight the war, the president made what he calls a very difficult decision, to provide cluster munitions, canisters filled with a large number of small bombs that can be dropped over a wide area. Some Democrats says cluster munition should never be the solution. Today, President B had a phone call with President E of Turkey and he pushed for Sweden to join NATO as soon as possible. So far Turkey has objected, accusing Stockholm of failing to crack down on groups it considers to be terrorists.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 07.08.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.08.23/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Jul 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.08.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Extreme weather has struck all over the country this summer. And this weekend is no different, with millions enduring scorching temperatures, and in some places brutal humidity. But the worst maybe yet to come. The National Weather Service says parts of the West and Southwest are experiencing a heatwave that could near or top records for both intensity and longevity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people here in California are outside enjoying this break in the weather, as another stifling heat wave is just days away. Meanwhile, millions of others suffering in triple digit temperatures with no end in sight. In Phoenix, there hasn’t been a day cooler than one hundred and ten degrees this month, with excessive heat warnings expected to last through at least next week. Adding to the danger, red flag warnings as the Southwest braces for what could be yet another grueling record-breaking heat wave. M.M and other scientists warn climate change could also trigger more devastating wildfires like the ones in Canada that exposed millions to dangerous air. To prevent even more extreme weather events. Professor M warns actions is needed now. Now experts say everyone could help cool the planet by just using less gas, energy and water.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 07.07.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.07.23/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Jul 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.07.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with those dangerous heat conditions sweeping the nation, more than ninety million Americans in thirty-three states are seeing temperatures above ninety-degrees, while forty-five million of you are experiencing feels-like temperatures in the triple digits. The southwest is in the midst of one of the longest heat waves on record. The Grand Canyon, State of Arizona is facing some of the most brutal conditions. The city of Phoenix was the hottest metro area in the US today, with the actual temperature reaching one hundred eleven degrees. Health officials in that region are urging caution. They’re advising people to remain indoors, wear light clothing, and, of course, check on family, and friends, and neighbors, especially the elderly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is reason for concern. Heat-related deaths here in Maricopa County have more than doubled since 2019, hitting four hundred and twenty-five last year. Doctors say this kind of heat can become dangerous in as little as fifteen minutes. A border patrol helicopter raced to rescue two people in southern Arizona dangerously overcome by the desert’s searing heat. This newly released video shows medic being lowered to the man and woman, one drifting in and out of consciousness. They were hoisted into the chopper and transported to a Tucson area hospital, Monday. The Phoenix area is in the midst of a potentially historic heat waves. So far this year, forty-four days have topped a hundred degrees, the past eight over one ten. In Death Valley, California, a sixty-year-old man was found dead in his car the morning after the temperature hit 126.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 07.06.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.06.23/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jul 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.06.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with another day of brutal heat in more than half of the country. More than sixty-seven million Americans in thirty-one states saw temperatures top ninety degrees today. The sizzling heat was felt all the way from deserts of Arizona to the lighthouses of Maine. And if that’s not hot enough, nearly forty million of you experienced feels-like temperatures in the triple digits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The high temperature here in Miami today was ninety-five degrees. But when you factor in the humidity, it felt like a hundred and ten degrees. All part of a heat dome that has parts of the country sweltering. Even by south Florida standards, this heat is excessive. According to the National Weather Service which issued an advisory for the third day in a row. And it’s not just Florida, in Bangor, Maine, near record-high temperatures are keeping firefighters busy with emergency calls. None of us that live in Maine are used to this kind of heat. While in Western New York, people flocked to local pools to stay cool as heat indices approached one hundred. By one calculation, the last three days have broken the record for the hottest average temperature on Earth. For perspective, the number of days above ninety degrees per year in Miami Dade County has been going up according to a county report in 1960, it was eighty-five. Last year, it was a hundred and thirty-three.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 07.05.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.05.23/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jul 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.05.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin with the Secret Service leading an investigation into who brought cocaine into the White House. The surprising discovery of a bag of suspicious white powder initially caused a panic leading to a temporary closure of the building on Sunday. The illegal drug was found near a visitor entrance for those who taking a tour of the West Wing. Today, lab test came back positive for cocaine. President B and the first family were at Camp David at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight, the White House says it is very important to President B to get to the bottom of who brought that illegal drug inside, but officials caution this could be a challenging investigation. Tonight, the leading theory is that someone on a White House tour may have left a small bag of cocaine in the West Wing. According to senior law enforcement officials, the discovery Sunday night put the White House on temporary lockdown until the substance was deemed not a threat. The bag was discovered on the ground floor, in a common area near the entry to the West Wing, not far from the Situation Room. It was close to a set of storage cubbies, where visitors leave their cell phones during a tour. The Secret Service is leading the investigation looking at visitor logs and camera surveillance. White House visitors undergo background checks and go through magnetometers on site, but the Secret Service does not have K-9 units that target illegal drug. Instead, the dog searched for explosives, biohazardous materials, and weapons.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 07.04.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.04.23/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jul 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.04.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin this Independence Day with another around of severe weather wreaking havoc at the nation’s airports that causing headaches for airlines and passengers. Thunderstorms and heavy rains created near blinding conditions for drivers on Interstate 85 Alabama. And storms from the Great Plains to the Northeast caused delays and a temporary ground stop at all three major New York area airports. Torrential rains and a lightning strike even caused a two-hour delay at the iconic Nathan’s Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest on New York’s Coney Island. Meanwhile, the brutal heat is nothing to celebrate as more than one hundred million Americans will see temperatures toping ninety degrees as they gather for barbecues and, of course, fireworks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another day here in Phoenix under an excessive heat warning. And for flyers, particularly those trying to get in and out of Denver and New York area it has to feel a bit like Groundhog Day, yet another day where severe storms have popped up snarling thousands of flights. On this Independence Day, the booms in the sky aren’t coming from fireworks. Beachgoers in Rhode Island ran for cover after storms rolled in. And in nearby Johnston, two children were injured after being struck by a falling tree brought down by wind, according to the fire department. Elsewhere, severe weather brought flights to a halt at major hub airports in Denver and New York. Where on Coney Island, somebody was hospitalized after being struck by lightning. And the weather caused a lengthy delay for a 4th July tradition. Mother nature’s firework display got started early this year, a two-week stretch of storms adding up to a staggering total of airline delays and cancellations.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 07.03.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.03.23/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jul 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.03.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin with travel chaos at US airports over the 4th of July holiday weekend. Long lines of air travelers packed terminals from coast to coast with New York area airports hit the hardest. Passengers have faced more than twenty-six thousand flight delays and more than fifteen hundred cancelations since Friday, but conditions are slowly improving. Heavy storms and torrential rains were the main culprits, but the severe weather is not over. Tonight, large parts of the US, from the Carolinas to New York, are bracing for dangerous storms to Independent’s Day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Passengers in this long line behind me are hoping to get out of the airport ahead of possible storms later tonight. It is a familiar scene in what’s been a very challenging summer travel season. Airlines are trying to bounce back as the airports brace for the crush of passengers heading home after a long 4th of July weekend. On Friday, TSA officers screened more than 2.8 million people across the country, a record, beating their previous high since the Sunday after Thanksgiving in 2019. This comes on the heels of an especially frustrating travel week with more than forty-nine thousand flights delayed and more than eight thousand canceled between June 24th through the 30th, in part due to severe weather. Those not taking to the skies, are hitting America’s highways, AAA predicts a record 43.2 million Americans will drive this holiday weekend. That’s 4% increase from the previous all-time high, a 41.5 million in 2019. And gas prices are down for a $1.27 compared to last year. The more severe weather hampered travelers over the weekend as heavy rains in Chicago shut down I-55 in both direction on Sunday. Officials say at least ten cars were trapped in the floodwaters. Meanwhile, in St. Louis, a woman was killed after a tree fell on her car during a storm. If you are hitting the road tomorrow, AAA says the best time drive is before 11AM or after 6PM. As for the airports, the FAA is expecting nearly fifty thousand flights on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 07.02.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.02.23/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jul 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.02.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, a manhunt is underway for at least two shooters behind a barrage of bullets at a Baltimore block party. What started as an evening of celebrations ended with dozens running for their lives. Police say the suspects opened fire and shot thirty people, nearly half of them children. Two of them died including a teenager. It is unknown if this was a targeted attack, but we do know tonight this marks the 338th mass shooting in America so far this year. This began as a holiday weekend tradition, a barbecue, party, music. And it ended up in a tragedy that has jolted this city. At a 4th of July weekend block party, at first, the gunshots were mistaken for holiday fireworks. Witnesses describe a sea of bullets after midnight at what began as a family night of fun. At least thirty people shot, an eighteen-year-old woman and a twenty-year-old man killed. And a night later, the search for suspects is still underway. Authority say they are looking for multiple shooters. City Police records show this was the 310th shooting so far this year in Baltimore, and one that has staggered a city at the start of what was supposed to be a week of celebrations. Kids as young as thirteen were among the thirty victims, and at least four of them were taken to a pediatric emergency room.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 07.01.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.01.23/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Jul 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.01.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin this 4th of July weekend with severe heat, scorching much of the country and it comes as a record number of travelers nearly fifty-two million, according to AAA, leave home for the long holiday. Temperatures from California to the Gulf Coast are in the danger zone. Merced, California is baking under a hundred and eleven degrees, New Orleans checking in at one hundred degrees, and Tampa, Florida, a relatively mild ninety-seven. Millions of Americans are spending the holiday weekend at beaches to escape the triple digit temperatures in some parts of the country. As the mercury climbs, so does the danger. California’s first heat wave of the summer has many trying to cool off by the ocean. Crowds coming to Santa Monica to take their spot in the sand. The sun is scorching Texas, Arizona, Nevada and California, upping the risk of heatstroke. Texas is under a punishing heat dome. Austin and Fort Worth hit triple digits everyday this week, adding to the spike in emergency room visits. The CDC says doctors in Texas and nearby states treated more than one thousand patients a day for heat-related illnesses. The holiday and heat has firefighters bracing for more wildfires like this one in Colorado. To reduce the threat, crews are getting rid of trees and vegetation. Water school and cooling centers are popular, as Americans look for relief. Doctors advise everyone to drink lots of water and wear loose fitting clothes to prevent heat illness.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 06.30.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-06.30.23/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jul 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-06.30.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin with the Supreme Court rulings, on LGBTQ rights and President B’s student loan forgiveness program. In a six to three decision, justices threw out the administration’s plan to cancel $430 billion in student loan debt for up to forty-three million Americans. The six conservative justices said the plan exceeded the president’s authority to grant such relief without authorization from Congress. The nation’s highest court also voted six to three in favor of a Christian graphic artist who objects to designing websites to promote same-sex marriages, saying her right to free speech outweighs antidiscrimination laws. President B said the court misinterpreted the Constitution and announced new efforts to help students deal with their debt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the Court term came to an end, its conservative majority again asserted its dominance, both on the tension between the First Amendment and state antidiscrimination laws and on the repayment of student loans. And in that case, the High Court dealt with B White House a significant setback. Writing for the majority, Chief Justice J.R said the B administration overstepped its legal authority to justify sweeping student loan cancellation plan. The 2003 law allows the administration to quote “to waive or modify statues pertaining student loans during national emergencies”. R wrote “it does not permit basic and fundamental changes in the scheme designed by Congress”. The administration sought to use the Covid emergency to cancel some $400 billion in student loans, one of the most expensive executive actions in the US history. At the White House, the president said he would seek other ways to fulfill the campaign promise to lower student loan burdens. Around forty million Americans would have qualified for some debt forgiveness, including Howard University Graduate, E.Q who owes about $45,000.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 06.29.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-06.29.23/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jun 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-06.29.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with the Supreme Court striking down affirmative action and reshaping college admissions. In a six to three decision, the justices ruled that Harvard University and the University of North Carolina violated the constitution by considering race when deciding whether to admit someone to their school. A landmark case overturning nearly fifty years of precedent, the latest example of the conservative majority redefining American law, including abortion rights and guns. The ruling means higher education institutions will need to come up with ways create diverse student bodies. Groups of protesters, mostly made up of young adults gathered outside the court to voice their outrage. And to underscore how monumental this case is, six of the nine justices wrote opinions, many personal and strongly worded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With justices on the touchstone issue of race talking to and past one another. This sweeping and historic ruling effectively ends affirmative action in college admissions reversing decades of precedent that less conservative court majorities had protected and giving colleges and universities some latitude to consider race as one factor as they sought build more diverse student bodies. Writing for the majority, Chief Justice J.R said admission policies of Harvard University and the University of North Carolina violated the fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause. In a scathing dissent, Justice S.S accused the court majority of ignoring history and precedent. The opinion also exposed deep personal and ideological divisions within the court. Justice K.B.J, the first black woman to serve on the high court, wrote in her dissent, quote “With let-them-eat-cake obliviousness, today, the majority pulls the ripcord and announces colorblindness for all by legal fiat”. Outside the court, students and civil right leaders assembled to protest. E.B, the president of Students for Fair Admissions, brought the case to the court, arguing race should not factor into admissions decisions at all. Ending racial preferences in college admissions is an outcome that the vast majority of all Americans of all races will celebrate. CBSN polling shows that seventy percent of Americans think race should not be allowed as a factor in college admissions. But statistics indicate that in states that have banned affirmative action such as California and Michigan, admissions for Black and Latino students have fallen dramatically at their most selective universities.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 06.28.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-06.28.23/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jun 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-06.28.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with tens of millions of Americans facing another round of air quality alerts due to that heavy smoke from those Canadian wildfires. Residents across seventeen states from Iowa to New York to as far as south as the Carolinas are being urged to take cautions. Especially for those with underlying medical conditions. Some big cities are issuing warnings for people to limit their time outdoors or wear masks to minimize potential health risks. Elsewhere, brutal heat, is bearing down on more than a dozen states across the south. Today, about seventy-six million Americans experienced feels like temperatures above one hundred degrees. And in Texas, the extreme heat is causing roads to buckle. At least thirteen people have died. All this comes as long lines at US airports are finally starting to move again, following days of travel nightmares caused severe weather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the air quality has worsen, some reporting and outdoor have been canceled as people try to avoid the unhealthy are coming from Canada. Thick smoke is once again choking the Midwest and Northeast. More than one hundred million people are under an air quality alert as the haze from these massive wildfires in Canada swallow up parts of the country. Chicago, Detroit, Pittsburgh and Cleveland have unhealthy air conditions. In the west, the battle is on against the wildfires.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 06.27.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-06.27.23/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jun 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-06.27.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin with powerful storms pounding the east coast, causing another day of headaches for airlines and thousands of passengers. Airports in the northeast were filled with long lines and frustrated travelers who face hundreds of delays and cancellations today due to the weather. The domino effect has been felted at airports nationwide this week with more than twenty-three thousand flight delays and more than five thousand cancelations since Sunday. From the thunderstorms and torrential rains in the northeast, to the record-breaking temperatures from Texas to Florida. Nearly ninety million Americans are under heat alerts tonight with triple digit feels-like temperatures expected in parts of at least ten states on Wednesday, including the entire state of Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people you see behind me are United Airlines passengers with canceled flights. They’ve been waiting for hours in this line behind me which stretches down the terminal for a confirmed flight, most of them just trying to get home. But the current projections are flight conditions won’t improve anytime soon. It’s yet another travel meltdown. Several days of severe weather causing chaos at airports, especially in the Northeast. United Airlines hit the hardest with roughly one hundred and fifty thousand passengers impacted since the weekend. Thousands have been stranded at Newark Airport. Partly to blame is a series of thunderstorm systems leading to torrential rains and flash flooding across parts of New Jersey and Pennsylvania with wind gusts up to seventy miles per hour. In the south, dangerous heat is raising concerns.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 06.26.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-06.26.23/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jun 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-06.26.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We want to begin tonight with the aftermath of short-lived rebellion that pushed Russia to the brink of civil war. And tonight, it is binging new questions: Is V.P’s iron grip on power in peril? The Kremlin is trying to project a sense of calm, but the extent of the damage to the dictator’s standing among the Russian people is still unknown. Tonight, we are hearing for the first time from the mercenary leader since he led the uprising. He claims the mutiny was never an attempt to overthrow the government in Moscow. In a meeting with Russian security officials tonight, P thanked them for their support including the defense minister, who the Wagner Group wanted to be removed. President B today breaking his silence, saying the west played no role in the mutiny. NATO allies and the world are closely monitoring the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man behind Russia’s rebellion is offering his own reason for backing down, saying tonight that he wanted to avoid major bloodshed. Y.P broke his silence today, releasing an audio message for the first time since agreeing to exile after his failed insurrection. The Wagner leader denied trying to overthrow Russian President V.P and said his fight was with the country’s military leaders. But hours later, the Russian president responded, calling Wagner’s actions a rebellion and vowing to bring its organizers to justice. US officials tell CBSN, they believe P was still in Russia as of this morning, but his current whereabouts are unknown. The revolt began Friday evening, when P blamed a Russian airstrike killing a large number of his fighters. In retaliation, the mercenary boss marched his troops into Russia and seized the city of Rostov, home to Russia’s southern military command. P then directed them toward Moscow to deal, he said, with Defense Minister S.S and his top general. Social media captured the death and destruction along the way. President V.P began to lock down the capital as soldiers took up defensive positions. Heavy equipment ripped up the roads leading to the city.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 06.25.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-06.25.23/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jun 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-06.25.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin with that fallout from the rebellion against Russian President V.P and his military officials. Tonight, the whereabouts of P’s former ally Y.P are unknown. Kremlin officials say he is headed to Belarus and will not face any consequences for publicly criticizing P’s war strategy. P blames P for a missile strike on his own mercenary soldiers in Ukraine. As a result, the sixty-two-year-old advanced his men in an armed revolt towards Moscow, making it to within one hundred and fifty miles of the capital before backing down. Ukrainian President V.Z had this message for P, claiming the man from the Kremlin is quote “very afraid and probably hiding somewhere”. On social media, Z touted a positive and inspiring conversation with President B adding that the world must keep pressure on P.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The events in Russia played out like a movie. It had a whole cast of characters and an ending of many didn’t anticipate. Residents cheered Wagner fighters as they left the Russian city of Rostov. From the hero’s farewell, it would be hard to tell the mercenaries failed in their mutiny. The group’s leader Y.P smiled and posted for selfies on his way out. Some greeted the returning Russian authorities less warmly, hurling insults. For hours, the world watched Wagner forces march toward Moscow. Social media tracked every update of their advance. Russian authorities locked down the capital. And with Kremlin’s focus elsewhere, Ukraine seized the opportunity launching major assaults along the front. Troops cleared Russian trenches near Bakhmut while Ukrainian soldiers rained down artillery on their positions. It was the war in Ukraine that sparked the rebellion in Russia. P accused the Russian military of killing his men with a missile strike, a claim Russian Defense officials denied. His men quickly seized Rostov, home of Russia’s southern military headquarters before advancing for Moscow. A furious President V.P went on state TV to call for P a traitor. But with Wagner troops knocking on Moscow’s gates, the Kremlin cut a deal. Wagner troops would be pardoned and returned to their bases. Criminal charges against P would be dropped and he would go into exile in Belarus, whose leader brokered the agreement.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 06.24.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-06.24.23/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jun 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-06.24.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with whiplash on the global stage. The world watched minute by minute as the Wagner Group, soldiers for hire fighting for P in Ukraine, turned on Russia’s military. They started advancing into Russia, gaining ground toward Moscow. Y.P, once a close friend of P, leading the charge. He was enraged by what he says were Russian strikes on his troops in Ukraine. But almost as suddenly as the advance started, the mercenaries began treating. They backed down after a deal broker by Belarus. P agreed to drop charges against P, who left the Russian city of Rostov to cheers. The Kremlin says he agreed to live in exile in Belarus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A tense calm grips Moscow tonight. The crisis threatened Russian President V.P’s hold on power seems to be cooling off. Wagner troops advanced within one hundred and fifty miles of the capital when Belarus announced it struck a deal between P and Wagner boss, Y.P. P stated on social media his troops would turn around to avoid spilling Russian blood, ending a potential destabilizing showdown. The spark of rebellion in Russia began yesterday in Ukraine. Video posted by Wagner showed the alleged aftermath of a deadly missile strike killing dozens of its troops. The mercenary group’s leader blamed the Russian military. Despite their denial, a furious P vowed vengeance. This morning, Wagner forces seized the Russian city of Rostov-on-Don, home to the country’s southern military command. The Russian president condemned P on state TV as a traitor who stabbed the country and its people in back. Video posted on social media tracked Wagner’s progress toward the city along with the failed attempts by the Russian military to stop the mercenary group. This video allegedly shows a Russian helicopter attacking an oil storage facility along the way while heavy equipment ripped up the highway to the capital. But with Wagner knocking on Moscow’s door, the deal will now see those troops return to their bases.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 06.22.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-06.22.23/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jun 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-06.22.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with the search for answers following the tragic outcome for the submersible that went missing in the Atlantic. Officials say a catastrophic explosion destroyed the vessel and killed all five people on board. Well, family members and others are now questioning how and why the expedition was allowed to go ahead with its design and lax safety measures. The US Coast Guard has reportedly declared the incident to be a quote “major marine casualty” and will lead the investigation into the cause of the implosion. An international team of ships with advanced underwater equipment remain on site to scour the ocean floor for more debris and evidence of the doomed vessel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Canada and the US have now launched investigations into the implosion of the Titan. The tragic end of the submersible and its passengers is also raising questions about whether the company operating it took shortcuts on safety. The search for the submersible survivor is now a search for answers as investigators analyze debris found on the ocean floor to find out what went wrong. The Coast Guard says the twenty-two-foot Titan broke into fields of debris, including its nose cone and both ends of the pressure hull made of carbon fiber and titanium. The hull likely imploded under what M says is the water pressure amounting to the weight of Empire State building.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 06.21.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-06.21.23/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jun 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-06.21.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with the desperate search for that missing submersible vessel. It was carrying five passengers and disappeared during an expedition to the sunken wreckage of the Titanic. Coast Guard officials say they have detected underwater noises for the second straight day. The sounds, which have been described as banging noises have given rescuers hope. But they admit they do not know the source of the noises. Now, more ships and other vessels are being moved into the area to assist in what authorities are still calling a search and rescue operation including a robot capable of reaching the ocean floor than two miles down. If those on board are still alive, time is clearly running out. It’s believed the passengers might only have enough oxygen to survive until Thursday morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Search teams today battled tough conditions, wind gusts of up to thirty miles per hour and seven-foot waves. But Coast Guards says they’re still treating this as a search and rescue operation. The underwater banging sounds detected by Canadian planes for a second day are sparking flickers of hope in the search for the missing submersible. A team of experts are trying to figure out where they are coming from. Coast Guards also can’t rule out the sounds could be coming from the Titanic itself. The search area is now two times the size of Connecticut and up to two and a half miles deep, deeper than stacking nearly nine Empire State buildings. With potentially just hours to go before the Titan’s five passengers run out of oxygen, at least eight more rescue ships are joining the international effort. And a French deep diving robot that can operate on the ocean floor is set to arrive tonight. Search team are unsure if the vessel is sitting on the bottom of the ocean where the conditions are near freezing and pitch black. OceanGate, whose CEO and founder, S.R was piloting the submersible has faced criticism. According to 2018 court filings, a former employee said he was fired after voicing concerns about the Titan saying it poised potential danger to passengers as it reached extreme depths.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 06.21.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-06.21.23/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jun 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-06.21.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin with a major development in the search of that missing submersible in the Atlantic Ocean. Coast Guard officials says the vessel a, quote, “catastrophic implosion” near the wreckage of the Titanic killing all five people on board. It’s the worst possible outcome for the international team of rescuers who were racing against time to save their lives of those passengers. Earlier today, two debris fields were discovered less than two thousand feet from the Titanic by Canadian ship’s remotely-operated vehicle. It was scanning the ocean floor. Experts say the debris fields are consistent with a catastrophic loss of the pressure chamber. The Coast Guard said five major pieces of the vessel have been found but it is not clear if the recovery of the bodies will ever be possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Coast Guard here in Boston which led the international search efforts says it’s too soon to tell why the submersible imploded. They’re offering condolences to the families of the five passengers on board who lost their lives. A tragic end to a frantic search. The debris of the missing submersible Titan was found about sixteen hundred feet from the Titanic wreckage. The cause of the implosion is still unknown, but all five people aboard were killed. OceanGate founder S.R, billionaire H.H, Pakistani businessman S.D and his nineteen years old son and French explorer PH.N. The Titan has been missing since Sunday, when it descended to the Titanic wreckage site about two and a half miles beneath the North Atlantic. Sparking a massive international search covering about ten thousand square miles. The company OceanGate Expeditions charges $250,000 to see the Titanic up close. But OceanGate has faced criticism from a group of experts in the submersible industry who wrote a letter to the company in 2018 warning of possible catastrophic problems. One of those experts, W.K said the Titan hadn’t passed safety standards.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 06.20.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-06.20.23/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jun 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-06.20.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin with the race against the clock to find that submersible vessel that disappeared in the north of Atlantic Ocean on Sunday. It was headed to the sunken wreckage of the Titanic. Experts say if the five people on board are still alive, they will run out of oxygen by Thursday morning. The explorers were heading to the cite of the Titanic’s final resting place. It’s located about nine hundred miles off Cape Cod and more than twelve thousand feet below the surface. An international rescue effort is now under way including help from the US navy, the US Coast Guard and the Canadian Coast Guard. Officials say they’ve already searched an area about seventy-six hundred square miles with no signs of the vessel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight, the US Navy is bringing in special equipment to retrieve heavy objects from deep under the ocean in the event they’re able to locate the missing submersible. But hope for finding survivors is fading. Search crews are frantically scouring an area larger than the state of Connecticut. But so far, there’s no sign of the missing vessel, the Titan, and its five passengers. But time is dwindling fast because they’re running out of oxygen. For the past two years, the US-based company OceanGate Expeditions has used the submersible to take tourists to the famous Titanic shipwreck, charging two hundred fifty thousand dollars per person. At nearly two and a half miles below the ocean surface, the Titanic is located at roughly twice the depth of the Grand Canyon. Finding the Titan won’t be easy at those depths even if it’s floating on the surface. Rescuers are now gaming out different scenarios in the event they find it. Among the five missing passengers, H.H, a British billionaire who flew into the space on J.B’s Blue Origin rocket last year, Pakistani-British businessman S.D and his nineteen-year-old son S and PH.N a former diver with the French Navy and a seasoned Titanic researcher. Last year, OceanGate hosted CBSN Sunday morning D.P on an expedition to the Titanic, but just minutes into his dive, something went wrong.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 06.19.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-06.19.23/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jun 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-06.19.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with some breaking news in the desperate search for a small submersible that disappeared while taking a crew of five people to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean to view the Titanic shipwreck. The search area is located about seven hundred twenty miles from Halifax, Nova Scotia, where the wreckage sits about thirteen thousand feet below the surface. Coast guard officials say the twenty-two-foot submersible carries enough oxygen for about four days. Now, among the five people on board, according to family members, is explorer and British billionaire H.H. The last communication from the vessel was Sunday morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a race against time to find the submersible and those on board after a loss of communication an hour and forty-five minutes into its two-and-a-half-mile deep dive into the North Atlantic to see the haunting wreckage of the Titanic. The sub only carries around ninety-six hours worth of oxygen. And its crew, which is understood to include British Billionaire H.H hasn’t been heard from in over a day now. The US Coast Guard is leading multi-national search. OceanGate only started making deep sea expedition with tourists in 2021. A CSBN Sunday Morning team also made the journey to the ocean floor, which costs adventure tourists $250,000. At one point, the crew realized something was wrong. The RMS Titanic began it maiden and final voyage from Britain to New York in 1912. It was the largest passenger ship on earth at the time after it struck an iceberg and sank more than fifteen hundred people onboard were killed. Maritime experts are already warning conditions deep in the Atlantic are hard to predict and any attempt at a rescue for those trapped will be extremely difficult.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 06.18.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-06.18.23/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jun 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-06.18.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, we begin a new diplomatic push aim at cooling tensions with China.

&lt;p&gt;After more than five and a half hours of intense and very direct talk between Secretary B and his Chinese counterpart. There was at least one point of agreement. Try to stop the downward spiral in this relationship before the two countries veer into conflict. Secretary B and Foreign Minister Q.G, a close ally of President X.JP tackled a long list of grievances. The US goal? Open communication channels to avoid a military clash. Tensions spiked last summer when then House Speaker N.P visited Taiwan. And again in February, after the spy balloon shoot down. China’s defense chief refuses to speak with US Defense Secretary L.A at a time when Beijing is massively expanding its nuclear arsenal. Miscommunication risks a clash. Last month, a Chinese warship came within one hundred and fifty feet of slamming into an American ship transiting the Taiwan Strait. And in the South China Sea, a Chinese fighter jet buzzed the US Air Force. The divide runs deeper than a failure to communicate. B also pressed authorities to crack down on the flow of fentanyl. That drug is the number one killer of Americans under the age of fifty. After months of giving the US the cold shoulder, this opening from Beijing may signal interest in reducing friction, at least on the financial front. The US and Chinese economies are so intertwined. On Monday, Secretary B will meet with a top party official who oversees foreign policy. And if all goes well, he may get a face to face with President X.JP.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 06.17.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-06.17.23/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jun 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-06.17.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This Juneteenth holiday weekend has begun with more than forty million Americans threaten by dangerous storms and blistering heat. Tonight, the greatest danger is from Oklahoma to Florida. Large hail, damaging winds and tornadoes are possible. The latest severe weather follows this scary scene, a waterspout on the Gulf Coast blew ashore in clearwater. Two people were hurt. And in Perryton, Texas, the cleanup is still ongoing after an EF3 tornado destroyed nearly everything in its path, killing three people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s mid-June and it is acting like perhaps middle of May in terms of severe storms still rolling tonight and then tomorrow, Father’s Day, still rolling across parts of lower Mississippi Valley on towards the Gulf Coast, even into Florida here. The timing of this even before the sun comes up overnight, tomorrow morning, showers and thunderstorms are rolling across Oklahoma and Texas into Arkansas and Louisiana, into Mississippi and eventually Alabama, and more storms here across Florida as we head into your Father’s Day afternoon and evening time.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 06.16.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-06.16.23/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jun 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-06.16.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin with dangerous weather that is here to stay. Through next week, we will see record heat. And this weekend into Father’s Day, 10 states, from Colorado to Florida, are bracing for severe thunderstorms. It’s another around of serious weather after a night of tornadoes and widespread destruction across the South and Central parts of the country. At least five people were killed, including an eleven-year-old boy, when twisters high winds and thunderstorms swept across Mississippi, Florida and Texas. In the small city of Perryton, Texas, nearly two hundred homes were reduced to rubble and debris scattered around. Hundreds of thousands remain without power in six Southern states. In Florida’s panhandle, residents had to be rescued after fifteen to sixteen inches of rain fell in a matter of hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preliminary reports from the National Weather Service says this was the EF-2 tornado. That means wind speeds of up to one hundred and thirty-five miles an hour. And take a look at some of the damage that was left behind. You have metal and wood buildings that didn’t stand a chance. Even brick buildings took a beating. There are debris piles like this all around. This small city took a big hit, and it could take months to rebuild. Tonight, parts of the panhandle in pieces after a tornado, a quarter of a mile wide, tore through the small city of Perryton, Texas Thursday afternoon, wiping out row after row of homes and businesses. In its path, a mobile home park that officials say took a direct hit, many of the homes reduced to twisted piles of debris, some in flames. The body of eleven-year-old M.R was found. Also killed, C.B and B.R at the print shop she owned. Sections of Perryton’s Main Street are now unrecognizable including city hall and fire station. Firefighters, searching through the rubble for survivors found an American flag completely intact. Thursday’s storms were part of a violent severe weather outbreak that clobbered the South all week with monster tornadoes in Alabama and Georgia, hail, the size of baseballs throughout the region, and heavy rain. More than a foot in areas of the Florida panhandle. In Pensacola, more than two hundred people were recued after flash floods stranded them in an apartment complex.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 06.15.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-06.15.23/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jun 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-06.15.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with a significant cyber attack taking place across the nation and around the world. Federal agencies, state governments and major universities had been hit with a campaign of data theft and ransomware. CBSN has confirmed that the cyber security and infrastructure security agency is providing support to agencies that had been targeted. J.H University and its health system says the data breach may have impacted in sensitive personal and financial information including contact information and health billing records. Now, there is no confirmation about what group or country is behind the intrusions. But US intelligence believes a criminal organization operating inside Russia is responsible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A senior US government official told reporters there is no evidence to date that US military and intelligence agencies have been compromised. But a number of federal agencies have been hit. Tonight, senior government officials are racing to limit the impact of a one cyber expert is calling potentially the largest theft event in recent history. American targets include multiple federal agencies, including the Department of Energy, plus J.H affiliated hospital in Maryland and Florida, Georgia’s statewide University System and Minnesota Department of Education. British Airways was also hit. Officials say the hackers are part of a cyber criminal gangs called Clop, believed to operate from inside Russia. The cyber criminals are exploiting a software program called MOVEit, which companies and government agencies used to transfer data including personal information. The groups steal the data in this message believed to be from the hackers warns that if ransom is not paid after seven days, all your data will start to be published, sometimes on the dark web.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 06.14.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-06.14.23/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jun 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-06.14.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin with the dangerous threat to tens of millions of Americans. The south is bracing for a second rounds of storms tonight and into the overnight hours. This marks one of the nation’s most severe weather events since early spring. At least eight confirmed twisters touched down in Alabama and Georgia, leaving a path of destruction across several communities. Some areas have already seen significant damage, including roofs being ripped off homes, uprooted trees and down powerlines, all scattered across roadways. Fortunately, there are no reports of injuries. Authorities from Texas to Florida have issued watches and warnings for residents to remain cautious and limit travel areas where damage has occurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A half dozen reported tornadoes made for an unnerving few hours of weather across the south this afternoon and toppled the side of this Alabama business. Tonight, recovery from several tornadoes that tore across Alabama and Georgia today. A severe weather outbreak pummeling states from north to south. In Abbeville, Alabama, a reported large tornado cut through, damaging a few buildings while nearby Eufaula fared worse, a twister downing trees and powerlines. The storms are part of a late-season system parked over the southeast, bringing waves of severe weather and record rainfall to the region. Yesterday, the system brought baseball-sized hail to Texas. And temperatures in the Lone Star state will top triple digits for much of the next week.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 06.13.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-06.13.23/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jun 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-06.13.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The eyes of the world were focused on this courthouse behind me today. Former President D.T appeared before a judge on federal charges. Tonight, T is addressing his supporters and will likely address today’s historic events in a campaign style speech at his Bedminster, New Jersey golf club. This afternoon, T was booked and arraigned on thirty-seven criminal counts including the willful retention of national defense information, making false statements and conspiracy to obstruct justice. Thirty-one of the counts are for violations of the Espionage Act. Inside the courthouse, T was fingerprinted and provided a DNA sample, but was spared getting a mug shot taken. He pleaded not guilty to all the charges. Security was tight around the courthouse with federal statement and local police out in force as protesters and supporters took to the streets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former President T disparaged the historic proceeding today. But the legal and political reality is very serious. He is now facing criminal charges and a potential lengthy trial, all while running again for the Republican nomination. Former President D.T made his way to the arraignment this afternoon, waving to the supporters who lined the route and passing a spectacle of onlookers, protester and police gathered outside the Miami federal courthouse. Once inside, the former president along with W.N, who was also charged in the case, surrendered to authorities, got swabbed for DNA and were fingerprinted. There was no mug shot taken, and T was allowed to hold on to his passport. During the court proceeding, closed to the camera, T was expressionless, his hands folded as his lawyer entered a plea of not guilty to all thirty-seven charges. The former president emerged defiant and spoke to supporters back at his New Jersey golf club. Now, T faces a series of charges including illegally hoarding classified documents at his Florida estate that could lead to two decades in prison. According to the indictment, the highly sensitive material which included information about the US nuclear program and the military activities of adversaries were found throughout Mar-a-Lago, in a bathroom, in the Lake room, in the White and Gold ballroom and in a storage area all sitting unsecured while the club held more than one hundred social events with outside guests.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 06.12.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-06.12.23/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jun 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-06.12.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The first federal prosecution of a former president or current president of the United States. D.T arrived in Miami this afternoon ahead of his arraignment tomorrow, after being charged with mishandling classified documents and obstructing justice. Sources close to T’s legal team tell CBSN they expect him to plead not guilty. Security is tight, between Secret Service protecting and federal, state, and local law enforcement officials on alert for protests. Some crowd estimates are in the thousands. S&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The former president is huddling with his attorneys tonight in Florida. Sources say when he arrives at the courthouse tomorrow, he will plead not guilty. They also said T’s legal strategy at this time is directed by him and comes down to one phase, fight everything. The former President arrived in Florida this afternoon, prepare for his second arraignment in three months. Police have ramped up security outside the Miami courthouse where he’ll be processed. T and his allies have called for protests. And former Arizona gubernatorial candidate issued a veiled warning. Law enforcement sources say they’re monitoring plans for pro-T rallies, including one that may be organized by the proud boys. And violent online rhetoric has surged since indictment. The former President has remained defiant since the thirty-seven-count indictment was handed it up Friday, attacking the Special Counsel J.S. Several T’s 2024 rivals have echoed his grievance about the Justice Department. But former South Carolina Governor N.H also questioned T’s conduct.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 06.10.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-06.10.23/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jun 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-06.10.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Today, D.T, the only former president ever to face criminal charges made his first public remarks since this week’s bombshell federal indictment, thirty-seven felony counts. T rallied thousands of Republicans in Columbus, Georgia. He described both his legal trouble and his reelection campaign as a final battle with corrupt forces he maintains are destroying the country. Tonight, he speaks again in Greensboro, North Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Less than seventy-two hours since D.T is fingerprinted and has his booking photos taken by US marshals. He is trying to rally some political supporters here tonight, ahead of the biggest criminal case in American history. Just after touching down and then taking the stage in Georgia, D.T wasted little time slamming special counsel J.S’s indictment, which charges T with thirty-seven federal criminal counts including obstruction and conspiracy. The charges alleged T knowing kept and risked exposing records with America’s top secrets including nuclear and military capabilities showing some to a writer, and to a political ally and of trying to cover it up, attempting to convince his lawyer, or to work around his lawyer, to circumvent a search warrant. Speaking before a Greensboro, North Carolina crowd that T himself would address hours later, M.P also criticized the prosecution. Some Republican voters who came to hear T speak tonight said they expect the case will give T a political surge. But the legal peril is real when T faces a judge in Miami Tuesday afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 06.09.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-06.09.23/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jun 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-06.09.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with a historic moment in our nation’s two hundred and forty-seven years, a federal indictment revealing extraordinary and grave criminal counts facing D.T and the charges his actions have endangered US national security. This is it, the forty-nine-page indictment was unsealed today for everyone who wants to read it. It is breathtaking in its scope and devastating in its detail. There are thirty-seven counts against D.T including the voluminous evidence that prosecutors have unearthed in an investigation that lasted more than a year. We are also seeing for the first-time photos of boxes containing America’s most sensitive secrets scattered across Mar-a-Lago. One picture shows document spilled onto the floor. The evidence also includes tape recordings of a conversation in which D.T showed a group of people, without the proper clearance, highly sensitive military plans. And the concern is this, if such a plan were to be compromised or leaked, it could significantly endanger our US military troops. Well, the indictment today also accuses T of illegally holding document concerning the US nuclear program and more top-secret Pentagon plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Justice Department has never been before, the indictment of a former president on multiple charges. If convicted, D.T could face fines or significant jail time. The forty-nine-page indictment send D.T and a long-time aide, W.N, engaged in a conspiracy to keep classified documents he had taken with him from the White House and to hide and conceal them. These new photographs from court filings show government documents strewn throughout Mar-a-Lago, boxes stored in a public ballroom, piled carelessly in a bathroom, tucked under a water pipe, and tossed on a storage room floor. Some of the documents prosecutors say were marked top secret, off limits to foreign nationals, some relating to nuclear weapons capabilities of the US and its adversaries. As well as sensitive US military planning. Special Counsel J.S made his first public statement about the investigation but took no questions. Making the case that the former president obstructed justice, the indictment quotes an alleged conversation between T and his lawyer with T saying “Wouldn’t it be better if we just told them we don’t have anything here?”. And suggesting that his attorney hide or destroy documents that were demanded by a subpoena.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 06.08.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-06.08.23/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jun 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-06.08.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight’s CBS Evening News with breaking news. Former President D.T has been indicted on charges of mishandling classified documents at his Florida estate. For the first time in American history, a former president is facing federal charges. D.T posting on social media just tonight, that he is expected to surrender to authorities in Miami on Tuesday at 3:00 PM. Mr. T calling this a dark day for America. CBSN has learned that there are seven counts. These charges are related to the national defense information. Now, the indictment filed by the office of the Special Counsel J.S comes as there has been a wide-ranging investigation into the handling of top-secret documents and Mr. T’s efforts to retain power after his 2020 election loss. And make no mistake, this creates extraordinary situation as this places the US Justice Department in charge of an investigation of not only the former president but also the current Republican front runner for the 2024 presidential race. This is going to be messy politically. D.T already holds the historic place of being the only president to be twice impeached and now he is the first to be indicted on federal charges.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 06.07.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-06.07.23/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jun 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-06.07.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with a dangerous situation. Hazardous air quality alerts from the Northeast to Chicago and as far as South as Atlanta. Health officials are warning tens of millions of Americans in more than a dozen states to remain indoors. New York City tonight tops the list of cities with the worst air quality in the world as Manhattan’s famous skyline disappeared behind a thick fog that made America’s largest city look like the surface of Mars. And then take a look at this on this map from EPA. The darker the area, the more hazardous the air is to your health. Well, how dangerous is it? If you are outside right here in the nation’s capital, that’s equivalent to smoking a cigarette an hour. And the smoke from those Canadian wildfires led to ground stops and flight delays at New York area airports. Plus, the match-up between the Yankees and the White Sox was postponed tonight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What explains this eerie scene why this skyline disappears is tiny, tiny particles that are saturated in the air. Those particles are so small that can go into your lungs and potentially cause long-term damages of your body cannot expel them naturally. That’s why the state of New York is giving out a million N95 masks like this one and recommending that people use them. Today, the sun rose over the Northeast shrouded in smoke, haze covering Manhattan skyline and bridges and the Washington Monument in DC. Smoke was seen as far as South as Tennessee and even from space. It’s from an intense start to Canadian’s wildfire season fueled by high temperatures and dry conditions. The total number of acres destroyed the first half of the year there, almost twelve times the average. Time lapse video shows downtown Manhattan this morning. By mid afternoon the thick smoke cast an eerie glow, making the skyline barely visible. School districts in the Northeast canceled outdoor activities today. To protect yourself health officials advise staying indoors, closing your windows and using an air purifier if you have one. And if you are driving, recirculate the air in car. Doctors say if you feel chest pain, if you feel like you need to cough more, or are coughing more and if you are short of breath, definitely seek medical attention right away.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 06.06.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-06.06.23/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jun 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-06.06.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with the growing fears of an environmental catastrophe unfolding in Ukraine. And this is not because of the ongoing bombs and bullets raining down on citizens, but instead cascading flood waters are threatening thousands of people after a critical dam on the front lines was sabotage. We are learning those flood waters are expected to peak in the coming hours. Ukrainian President Z blamed Russian terrorists for blowing up calling it the largest man-made environmental disaster in Europe in decades. Take a look at these stunning satellite photos from before and then after the explosion. Look at all that water. It is rushing now towards cities and towns. Streets were returned into lakes and rivers and homes and businesses swept away. And it comes just as Ukraine is beginning its long-planned counteroffensive to retake territory held by Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blast smashed through the dam wall causing a massive breach as one section collapsed completely sending torrents of water surging towards the southern city of Kherson less than fifty miles away. Homes partially submerged, some even floating away and once fertile agricultural grounds now a soggy wasteland. The flooding has forced the evacuation of thousands of people. Some fled under fire. Others scrambled to protect their animals. The dam holds back a reservoir containing about the same volume of water as the Great Salt Lake in Utah and it is important for the safe running of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant which is also Kremlin controlled. The United Nation’s atomic energy body says that plant is safe for now. But Ukraine is furious from official outrage in Kiev with President Z accusing Russia of a brutal war crime to anger and loathing in Kherson.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 06.05.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-06.05.23/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jun 2023 21:53:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-06.05.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with that shook the ground and frightened residents across the Washington, DC area on Sunday. The military scrambled six F-16 fighter jets to intercept an unresponsive plane that had entered restricted airspace over the nation’s capital. President B was not at the White House at the time. The small plane eventually crashed in a rural area in Western Virginia. NTSB investigators are on the scene but they say it could take several days to collect all the evidence. Four people were killed and CBSN has learned the victims included forty-nine-year-old A.A, her two-year-old daughter, their nanny and the pilot. The US Capitol complex was placed on an elevated alert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are getting new information tonight from the FAA. FAA officials tell us that air traffic controllers lost contact with that small plane about fourteen minutes into the flight. That flight came to an end here. You see this hilly terrain behind me. You can imagine how treacherous it is for investigators, who are out here trying to sift through the wreckage. But getting to the wreckage is a problem all unto itself. The wreckage is about a mile and a half out but it takes about three and a half hours to hide there. From above a large crater scars the terrain where the Cessna plane crashed. Today, the NTSB was at the scene looking for evidence. The plane took off in Tennessee yesterday afternoon, flying to Long Island, New York at thirty-four thousand feet where it made a U-turn. A half hour later, six F-16 fighter jets intercepted the plane as it illegally breached Washington’s airspace crashing minutes later. The pilot did not respond to repeated calls from air traffic controllers and flares from the fighter jets. CBSN has learned that one of the F-16 pilots saw the Cessna pilot slumped over and unresponsive. The sonic boom of the jets breaking the sound barrier startled millions around the Capitol. R.S, a former chairman of the NTSB says the plane’s cabin may have lost pressure.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 06.04.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-06.04.23/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jun 2023 21:13:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-06.04.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with new tensions between global rivals. Today, China’s Defense Minister are aggressively defended sailing a warship directly in front of an American missile destroyer. Speaking at a summit in Singapore, he warned the West to stay out of waters and aerospace near China’s borders. The dangerous close encounter happened in the Taiwan Strait separating Taiwan from China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addressing an audience of global security officials, China’s Defense Minister, General L. SF had some blunt advice for the United States. He was reacting to criticism of an incident in the Taiwan Strait on Saturday when a Chinese warship crossed the course of an American destroyer so close, it had to slowed down to avoid a collision. Last week, a Chinese fighter plane pulled a similar maneuver in front of an American reconnaissance plane over the South China Sea. But the US sees routine patrol of the air and sea off mainland China as very much its own business to underscore its position that this is international space open to everyone. At a conference banquet on Friday. General L shook hands with the American Secretary of Defense L.A. But China declined a formal meeting and that, said Secretary A, is dangerous. Meanwhile, the US and China’s military continue to operate close to one another. Speaking to reporters off camera. Secretary A called on Chinese leaders to rein in dangerous conduct in case an accident spiraled out of control.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 06.03.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-06.03.23/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jun 2023 21:37:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-06.03.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with new tensions between the world’s largest military superpowers: The United States and China. At issue, the latest military moves here in the Strait of Taiwan between the island and China. New video shows a Chinese warship speeding up coming with a hundred and fifty yards of hitting the American missile destroyer, the USS Chung-Hoon. The Chinese ship even called the American vessel ordering it to move or there would be a collision. The US ship slowed to avoid a crash. News of the incident coming the same day US Defense Secretary L.A in Singapore issued this warning to Beijing. Eight days ago, a Chinese fighter jet in the same region flew so close to a US military plane, it created turbulence. China sees the US military presence in the South China Sea and Taiwan Strait as a violation of its sovereignty. Today is a day of mourning in India after its worst train disaster in decades. A passenger train derailed, crashing into two other trains and killing more than two hundred and eighty eight people.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 06.02.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-06.02.23/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jun 2023 21:38:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-06.02.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with the majority of the country facing hot and humid temperatures from the Midwest to the Northeast, ninety-seven million Americans across thirty-six states will see temperatures at or above ninety degrees. The official start of summer doesn’t come for another three weeks, but it already feels like it in cities from Decatur, Illinois, to Burlington, Vermont, which set new records highs today. Health officials are urging residents to check in on their neighbors, especially the elderly, who may not have air conditioning. In the Gulf of Mexico, Tropical Storm Arlene became the first named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season as it heads South towards Cuba. Florida residents in the southern part of the state could see several inches of rain through Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the Northeast and Midwest sizzled, a raging wildfire in New Jersey caused thick smoke that shut down the Garden State Parkway for a twenty-five-mile stretch before reopening. For nearly one hundred million people across the country, high temperatures are the issue. From Maine to Missouri, people tried to keep cool from the scorching sun. In Buffalo, the temperature hit ninety-one degrees. It was one of many cities to open cooling centers. While some chilled out here, others took to the water for relief. Philadelphia hit ninety-four degrees and enacted an excessive heat protocol, closing ninety public schools early that did not have air conditioning. Schools in Baltimore and Detroit also let students out early. It’s a different weather situation in Texas today. A tornado touched down in the western part of the state. No injuries were reported but a tornado watch remains in effect. West Texas could see flash flooding today. A local disaster was declared in Amarillo yesterday afternoon floodwater from a nearby lake inundated some homes and submerged vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 06.01.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-06.01.23/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jun 2023 21:38:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-06.01.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with surprising new details in the collapse of an apartment building in Davenport, Iowa. City officials today review that a structural engineer warned that the building’s brick façade was in imminent risk of crumbling. That’s just days before Sunday’s partial collapse. The report stated that the condition of the building’s exterior posed a safety hazard, yet residents were not told evacuate. Tenants had long complained about the building’s upkeep. Three residents of the six-story apartment building remain unaccounted for four full days after the collapse. Family members and friends are holding out hope that their loved ones will be found alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;City authorities are struggling to figure out when and how to demolish this building. Despite the destruction you see behind me and multiple complaints, the building had passed several inspections. The city’s chief building official signed off on at least one of those inspections and resigned yesterday. Tonight, the six-floor building remains cordoned off from the public, with three individuals presumed inside. Documents released last night by the city include notices of violations, engineering reports, and years of complaints from residents of cracks in the walls and ceilings. Repairing on the century-old building’s brick exterior began months ago. Then just days before the collapse, an engineer hired by the building’s owner reported that portions of the bricks façade appear ready to fall imminently.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 05.31.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-05.31.23/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jun 2023 21:38:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-05.31.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin with some breaking news right here in Washington with the House of Representatives passing a bipartisan deal to raise the debt limit. The legislation allows the US government to spend more money and pay its bills. The current debt is $31.8 trillion and counting. The bill now heads to the Senate as Congress races against the clock to prevent what could be disastrous consequences for the US economy. Speaker K.M spends the last few days wrangling votes as angry Freedom Caucus members threatened his leadership position. Several hardline conservatives voted no after feeling betrayed by the agreement made with President B. On the other side of the aisle, a number of liberal Democrats also voted against the bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a cliffhanger vote tonight, with last minute negotiations behind the scenes, and some vocal protests on the US House floor. Racing toward the June 5th deadline and trying to avert a potentially cataclysmic default on America’s debt, the House Speaker gave his deal a final push. He and President B expected they’d need dozens of Democrats to join Republicans to get it pass. The agreement raises the debt ceiling until January 2025. It caps some federal spending. It claws back money from the IRS. It tightens eligibility for food stamp programs and loosen some environmental rules. The bill passed even with a revolt from hardline conservatives who said it didn’t cut enough spending. And some progressive Democrats argued it cuts some money from the most needed. The bill goes next to the US Senate, where leaders hope to move quickly despite a group of mostly Republican opponents.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBSN Evening News 05.30.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbsn-evening-news-05.30.23/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 May 2023 21:04:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbsn-evening-news-05.30.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with the dramatic news that people may still be trapped underneath the wreckage of a partially collapsed apartment building in Davenport, Iowa. The mayor and police chief made the announcement at a press conference this morning amid criticism that rescue crews gave up looking for survivors too quickly. Officials say five people are missing including two who could be buried under the rubble. One survivor was rescued from a fourth-floor apartment Monday night just hours after authorities say everyone in the building had been accounted for. Search crews today were trying to find any sign of life as engineers warn that the unstable structure is on the verge of a full collapse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Residents have told us that this building has literally been failing apart for some time with bricks that they believe to be from the building often found on the ground. Davenport right now is tense. There are protesters camped out near this site demanding that everyone be recovered before a demolition. Rescue crews may search the building again, but it’s unclear when due to safety concerns. The city said on Monday demolition was expected to begin Tuesday morning but later clarified it would be a multi-step process. Officials say they believe the two people who may still be in the building are unlikely to have survived.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBSN Evening News 05.29.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbsn-evening-news-05.29.23/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 May 2023 21:04:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbsn-evening-news-05.29.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with the partial collapse of a six story, eighty-four-unit apartment building in Davenport, Iowa. Tonight, first responders are being hailed as heroes after rushing into the unstable building to rescue eight people. Canine units spent last night going through the building in search of additional victims and incredibly no deaths or serious injurious have been reported and the authorities believe everyone has been accounted for. Now the frightening scene unfolded on Sunday evening in the downtown area of Iowa’s third largest city. Right now, officials are working to determine the cause of the collapse and have ordered the demolition of the apartment. Current and former residents say they had long complained about poor maintenance conditions in the building and that issues rarely fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials say they don’t have credible information that anyone still missing about family members and a co-worker we spoke to say at least two people have not been accounted for since the collapse. When first responders arrived at the scene just before 5PM yesterday they found part of the buildings back section had detached and collapsed. They rushed in, the mayor says at great risk to their own lives. Davenport Fire Chief says his crews rescued at least eight people including one overnight. Now, the walls are stripped away revealing remnants of residents’ lives. Authorities say they don’t know yet the cause of the collapse but it’s set off natural gas and water leak. Officials say they received several complaints over the past few years about needed repairs and work was being done on the exterior with some reports of bricks falling.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBSN Evening News 05.28.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbsn-evening-news-05.28.23/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 May 2023 21:04:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbsn-evening-news-05.28.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;After days of negotiations and late-night conversations to increase the country’s 31.4 trillion-dollar debt limit, tonight there appears to be a bipartisan relief. The president and Republican leadership now have a tentative agreement that head off a potential default on the government loans. However, there is still many hurdles in the way as we await the text of that bill. Before President B can sign the deal, it must first pass the House then the Senate. Today, majority leader C.S put Senators on notice that a vote could come as early as next weekend before the June 5th deadline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The president spoke again today with Speaker M. He tells us he is confident this bill will reach his desk. President B expressed optimism that he can sell his budget deal to members of his party. Over on Capitol Hill, House Speaker K.M is working at getting the votes. The deal struck between the White House and GOP negotiators late Saturday night would raise the debt limit for the next two years. It would keep non-defense spending roughly at the same levels through 2024. The agreement protects social programs such as social security, Medicaid and new programs for veterans’ medical care but would temporarily place new work requirements on some receiving government assistance, including food stamps. The deal would also loosen environmental permitting for energy projects. Even as some progressive Democrats and conservative Republicans voice and tweet opposition, party leaders are sounding optimistic they can get it across the finish line. They first real test will be a vote in the House as early as Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBSN Evening News 05.27.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbsn-evening-news-05.27.23/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 May 2023 21:04:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbsn-evening-news-05.27.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;All eyes are on Capitol Hill tonight as the deadline for a possible government default closes in. Both President J.B and House Speaker K.M insist a deal is close. More on that in a minute. But we begin this Memorial Day weekend at the National Mall, where thousands are turning out at the Poppy Wall of Honor. The red flower symbolizes bloodshed of lives lost in service since World War I. There are more than six hundred forty-five thousand flowers lining the wall this year. And as always, many of us are also on the move for the holiday weekend. Whether by ground or air, travelers are feeling the impact of the economy both good and bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the beach to the boardwalk, this is a hot destination for people this Memorial Day weekend and just as the weather is heating up, so too is the travel season. Beaches across the country are opening now. Here on New York’s Coney Island, visitors are basking in the sun and opening their wallets, and business owner are ready to cash in. According to AAA, at least thirty-seven million Americans will drive at least fifty miles from home this weekend. That’s 2 million more than Memorial Day last year but still below pre-pandemic levels. Drivers may save a little bit of money. Nationwide gas prices are roughly $1 cheaper than last year. Travelers are also crowding the airports. In April, airfare jumped 2.7% from March. While it’s down slightly from last summer, it’s nearly 10% higher than it was before the pandemic. Hotels are also up 3.5% from last year and 15% more expensive than in 2019. Some Americans are staying closer to home, going to parades like this one in Chicago honoring those who served in the armed forces. In Little Rock, Arkansas, middle school students place flags on the gravestones of the falling soldiers. Back here on Coney Island, family are settling in for this busy holiday weekend. And driving to a destination like this maybe a more affordable option this year. The cost of renting a car is down about 11% since last year. But what you save there, you may be spending on food. We can also tell you the cost of dinning out is up 9% since last year.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBSN Evening News 05.26.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbsn-evening-news-05.26.23/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 May 2023 21:04:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbsn-evening-news-05.26.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, the holiday travel rush is in full swing with more than forty-two million Americans looking to get away for the long Memorial Day weekend. That’s a 7% last year. Now, a majority of you will be driving to your destinations hitting the road and traffic-jammed highways to celebrate the unofficial start of summer. Air travel will also be one of the busiest in years, with a post-pandemic record of nearly 3.4 million passengers. And nearly 2 million Americans are taking trains, buses or cruise this year. That’s up more than twenty percent from 2022. Much of will see warm temperatures and sunny skies. However, those in the Southeast should brace for heavy rain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started my day in Chicago this morning flying to Phoenix just a couple of hours ago. And you really get a sense for why the TSA was bracing for today to be one of the busiest days since the start of the pandemic. The airlines say Memorial Day weekend so far has been mostly smooth-sailing. The great summer getaway is on. The vast majority will be hitting the roads. AAA expects more than thirty-seven million Americans to drive.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBSN Evening News 05.25.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbsn-evening-news-05.25.23/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 May 2023 21:04:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbsn-evening-news-05.25.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with the first in a wave of sentencings of the ten people convicted of seditious conspiracy for their role in the pro-T January 6th assault on the Capitol. Well, today, a federal judge handed down the most severe prison sentence to date to the eye-patched founder of the oath-keepers. S.R, the fifty-eight-year-old leader of the far-right and antigovernment militia, was sentenced to eighteen years in prison for his crimes. R remained defiant declaring himself a political prisoner while prior to the sentence the judge had harsh words for R saying he led his followers during the insurrection in what amounted to domestic terrorism. The judge also told R that he presents “an ongoing threat and apparel to this country to the republic and to the very fabric of our democracy”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge said January 6th imperiled American democracy and S.R was a critical part of it. Then the judge issued a sobering warning about the risks that lie ahead. S.R is a Yale Law grad, a former service member and founder of oath keeper was convicted of conspiring to mobilize his own fighting force at the Capitol January 6th, planning weeks in advance to raise money, prepare gear, and to ready a team if then-president T invoked the Insurrection Act, which R urged in a letter to T. R, who lost an eye in firearms incident years ago, was accused of leading a plot to stage guns as near the Capitol as possible in January 6th. Federal judge A.M called R an ongoing threat to America and handed down a sentence that will keep R in prison until nearly 2040. R argued at sentencing he’s political prisoner that he and other T supporters are being targeted by a regime. And he claims the Oath Keepers were quiet professionals&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBSN Evening News 05.24.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbsn-evening-news-05.24.23/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 May 2023 21:04:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbsn-evening-news-05.24.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Breaking news in the presidential campaign of 2024. Florida Governor R.D just made it official, launching his bid for the Republican Nomination. But his announcement on Twitter was met with a lot of technical issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A launch for president on Twitter, Florida Governor R.D posted a video making it official and spoke on Twitter spaces alongside the controversial billionaire and CEO E.M who had said he’d support a conventional candidate. D late spoke to Fox News. D’s announcement kicks into motion a long-expected campaign now facing significant challenges as the GOP field expands and rivals call him out as an imitation of T. A T ally called D’s online launch out-of-touch and CBSN polling shows D trailing T by more than thirty points. Aides say D’s polices will boost his candidacy. But it remains to be seen how his track record, which includes signing conservative bills on abortion, transgender rights and education is seen nationwide. D’s rivals see him as an increasingly vulnerable due to T repeated attack. And sources tell me that those competitors will take on D directly on the campaign trail and on the debate stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back here in Washington, the suspect accused of crashing a rented truck into security barrier near the White House on Monday appeared in a DC courtroom today. Nineteen-year-old S.V.K of Chesterfield, Missouri was ordered to remain behind bars until a detention hearing on Tuesday. It comes as Department of Homeland Security issued a new terror related bulletin warning of threats based on ideological beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBSN Evening News 05.23.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbsn-evening-news-05.23.23/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 May 2023 21:04:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbsn-evening-news-05.23.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We want to begin with a security threat near the White House when a Missouri man attempted to drive a rented box truck into a barricade last night. According to court documents, the suspect told Secret Service agents that he planned the attack for six months with the intention of taking control of the White House and killing the president or anyone else that got in his way. The nineteen-year-old from the St. Louis suburb of Chesterfield appeared in court this afternoon on federal charge. The White House says the president was briefed this morning on the situation by the US Secret Service and the Park Police. The arrest comes as threats against lawmakers have surged in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an unexpected site for tourists near the White House tonight and that is last night’s crime scene. That U-Haul truck hit that barricade with such force that several pedestrians had to jump out of the way. Investigators believe the suspect intentionally crashed the twenty-six foot rental truck into the barricade at Lafayette Park shortly before 10 PM about a hundred yards from the White House fence. Behind the wheel, authorities say, was nineteen years old S.V.K. Court documents reveal that he told Secret Service agents that he flew one-way into Washington, DC from St. Louis Monday night, rented the truck at Dulles International Airport and drove directly to the White House. K has stated his goal was to get to the White House, seize power, and be put in charge of the nation and would “kill the president if that’s what I have to do”. The suspect was carrying this Nazi flag and, when asked, expressed admiration for Hitler. Threats against members of Congress have surged in the last six years. Just last week, a man attacks staffers at Congressman J.C’s office. Last fall, a man broke into N.P’s San Francisco home and attack her husband with a hammer.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBSN Evening News 05.22.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbsn-evening-news-05.22.23/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 May 2023 21:04:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbsn-evening-news-05.22.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We want to begin tonight at the White House with debt-limit negotiations taking place with the full faith and credit of the United States hanging in the balance. President B met with House Speaker K.M in the Oval office this evening in an effort to cut a deal that both sides can support. While the nation has been down this road before, the consequences of not reaching deal are not dire. Economists and business leaders warned of the catastrophic impact a default would have on the economy and financial markets around the world. Americans would begin feeling the ramifications almost immediately. Sixty-six million social security checks could be delayed while funding for food stamps and Medicaid would also be impacted. Paychecks for active-duty military members could be held up, some critics say would harm national security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treasury Secretary J.Y is issuing her starkest warning yet, that is highly likely the US will default on its bills as early as June 1st if Congress does not raise the debt ceiling. Despite that urgency, in another meeting here at the White House, tonight, there is no deal. President B and Speaker M met one on one this evening, both men hoping for a breakthrough. Congress must raise the nation’s borrowing in the next few days or risk the US defaulting on its debts. This afternoon, M said negotiators were on the right path. Republicans are demanding deep spending cuts in exchange for raising the debt ceiling. Sources tell CBSN the White House has offered to keep spending flat from this year to next. Republicans say they want to increase the defense spending while cutting everything else by up to twenty-two percent. Economists say failing to reach a deal would be disastrous and lead to a recession.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 05.21.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-05.21.23/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 May 2023 21:46:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-05.21.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with President B doubling down on his commitment to stand with Ukraine. The president held a bilateral meeting with Ukrainian President V.Z at the G7 summit in Japan. This as Russia claims victory in the longest running battle in the war. But today, Z denied that Bakhmut, battled scarred and deserted, is entirely in Russian hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was a last-minute surprise guest, and he’s definitely not the head of a G7 country, but there is no question who the undisputable big draw was on the last day of this G7 summit, President V.Z. Allied leaders sought him for a chat and reiterate their support, and President B announced a new multi-million-dollar shipment of US military equipment was on the way. On Saturday, in an about-face, the White House cleared the way for US made F-16 fighter jets piloted by Ukrainians to join the war. President B said he changed his mind to give the Ukrainians greater range as they advance. In Hiroshima, Japan’s Prime Minister showed V.Z around the Peace Park, a monument to the victims of US atomic bombing in World War II. It was a sobering remainder that V.P has implied he might use tactical nuclear weapons against Ukraine. President B was to have gone on from here to Australia for more international security meetings, but domestic politics meant that he has had to cancel that leg of the trip. He’s actually on his way home now to take control of negotiations over the debt ceiling.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 05.20.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-05.20.23/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 May 2023 20:52:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-05.20.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with a bold move by Ukraine’s President V.Z to shore up allied support against Russia. Z arrived in Hiroshima, Japan for face-to-face meetings with leaders of the world’s richest democracies. He is urging them to stick with Ukraine as Russia bets on the west growing fatigued by the cost of the war. Moments after landing, Z tweeted that peace will become closer today. President Z flew to Hiroshima on a plane provided by the French government. His star power will focus global attention on this summit which was always intended to showcase G7 leaders’ unwavering support for Ukraine. Even before he touched down, Z got one of the things he’d been asking for, F-16 fighter jets. After refusing for months, President B approved the training of Ukrainian pilots to fly the US-made warplanes. Various European allies are expected to supply the actual aircraft from stocks they already own. After some picturesque photo ops and closed-door meetings, the G7 leaders spelled out their common ground in a communique that sets out ambitious targets. They include developing controls for artificial intelligence, mechanisms to deal with Chinese economic bullying, and committing to ending fossil fuel use by 2050. The G7 leaders released their joint communique a day early to clear the decks for the star of the show V.Z who is going to be front and center tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 05.19.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-05.19.23/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 May 2023 23:12:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-05.19.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with the high-stakes showdown over the economy. The nation faces a possible catastrophic default if Democrats and Republicans can’t agree on spending limits before the June deadline. If a deal can’t be made, a default would mean that the government would run out of money and could pause military salaries, Medicare and Social Security payments. Republicans walked out of talks earlier today, blaming the White House for being quote “unreasonable”. The White House said both sides must be willing to compromise. But late today, news that both sides will return to the table and work late into the night as House Leader K.M expressed his frustration with the White House. The president is set to return to Washington on Sunday, cutting short his overseas trip in hopes of finalizing an agreement before the deadline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An ominous sign less than two weeks before a possible US default. Republican negotiators walking out on talks with White House officials who then departed too. House Speaker K.M said the two sides are at an impasse. The sticking point is government spending. In exchange for raising the nation’s borrowing limit, House Republicans want to impose caps that amount to an across-the-board 13% cut in government spending. The White House says it is open to some cuts, and that an agreement is still possible if both sides recognize that neither side will get everything it wants. Unless Congress acts, the US will default on its deadline as soon as June 1st, an outcome widely viewed as an economic calamity. The talks may be back on, but tonight, Speaker M is still insisting the government can’t spend anymore money than it did last year. And the White House is unlikely to go for that. And members of both parties are urging their leaders not give too much so the situation is still in major flux.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 05.18.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-05.18.23/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 May 2023 21:03:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-05.18.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, there are new details in the investigation of the deadly shooting rampage in Farmington, New Mexico. Police just this afternoon releasing bodycam video of the encounter with the eighteen-year-old gunman as he opened fire seemingly at random. Those killed included a ninety-seven-year-old mother and her seventy-three-year-old daughter. The third person killed was a seventy-nine-year-old mother of five who had been married for fifty-seven years. The gunman wore body armor and had an arsenal of weapons at his home, using three during the attack. Authorities also say they found a handwritten note on his body. The police chief described Monday’s shooting as sounding like out of a war zone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Body cameras captured the chaos as Farmington police and other law enforcement officers confronted the gunman, who police say had just fired more than one hundred and forty rounds from an AR-15 rifle. The shots missed one officer but hit Farmington Police Sergeant R.D. She’s hit in the pelvis and tries to run for cover as shots fly through the air. Within shots, officers are helping D and are taking aim at the suspect. Other surveillance video shows innocent victims driving unknowingly into the line of fire. Other drivers speed in reverse to safety. Last night, the small community of Farmington remembered the three women who died. The suspect legally bought the AR-15 last November, just a month after he turned eighteen. The handguns he got from family members. Police also confirmed to us, and you can hear on one of the videos, the suspect is yelling “kill me” at the officers. As far as what pushed him to the edge or a motive, we still don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 05.17.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-05.17.23/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 May 2023 21:03:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-05.17.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We want to begin tonight with the stunning allegation by Prince H and M.M’s spokesperson that they were involved in a near-catastrophic car chase at the hands of a ring of highly aggressive paparazzi allegedly involving half a dozen black-out vehicles, while the couple was in New York City as M.M was given an award by G.S during the Women of Vision Awards gala in Manhattan. The news that H and M were relentlessly pursued in a chase that resulted in multiple near-collisions brought back memories of the fatal car crash of H’s mother, Princess D in the summer of 1997. New York City Mayor E.A condemned the paparazzi and called their actions reckless and irresponsible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, the NYPD is investigating exactly what took place across the streets of the country’s biggest city last night, but for many, hearing that phrase “near-catastrophic car chase” certainly evoke the memory of the late Princess D’s death nearly twenty-six years ago. In Midtown Manhattan last night, Prince H and M.M stepped out to cheers and stepped into apparent danger after a spokesperson says, the royal couple were involved in a near-catastrophic car chase. The Duke and Duchess accused highly aggressive paparazzi of relentlessly pursuing them at times driving sidewalks in an incident lasting more than two hours. Law enforcement sources tell CBSN after leaving the event around 10PM, the couple did not want the paparazzi to know where they were staying, so they circled Midtown for more than an hour with NYPD squad cars providing crowd control. Police say while H and M were not in danger, two uniform officers could have been injured during the incident. At one point, the couple jumped into the back of S.S’s yellow cab outside the 19th Precinct, but he only drove them around for about ten to fifteen minutes. The couple finally arrived at the police station where they were able to switch cars and get home safely.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 05.15.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-05.15.23/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 May 2023 21:03:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-05.15.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We want to begin tonight with breaking news on the two hundred and twenty fifth mass shooting in the United States this year that has brought devastation to another community. At least three people were killed and nine others wounded including two police officers in Farmington, New Mexico. That’s a city about one hundred and eighty miles northwest of Albuquerque. Video from the scene shows vehicles which appear to have been run off the road after being targeted by the gunman. Every school across the city of nearly fifty thousand residents were placed in lockdown as the rampage unfolded. Officials say the two officers were injured during the shootout with the suspect who was later killed on the scene. CBSN has just learned that the gunman was eighteen years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dramatic audio as police in Farmington, New Mexico raced to the latest mass shooting, the manhunt urgent. Officers find the suspect, shown on this cell phone video, pacing. Two officers were hurt as they exchanged fire. Bullets struck multiple cars. This one ran off the road. Several schools were locked down until police confirmed the shooter was a lone gunman. Investigators just beginning to mark possible evidence in the case. Tonight, there is no known motive for the shooting. New Mexico governor released a statement calling it another remainder of how gun violence destroyed lives. And at this hour, both of those law enforcement officers who were shot are in stable conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 05.15.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-05.15.23/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 May 2023 21:03:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-05.15.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We do want to begin tonight with new details in Monday’s deadly mass shooting in Farmington, New Mexico that killed three people and wounded six others. This afternoon, police have identified the gunman as eighteen-year-old high school senior B.W. Authorities say he carried at least three weapons including an AR style rifle and appeared to target victims in random. They are still searching for motive. The two law enforcement injured during the attack were treated at the hospital. The police chief called it one of the most horrific and difficult days in the city’s history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shooting started at this intersection behind me stretched about a quarter of mile. Investigators say the suspect was shooting randomly at cars and hitting homes and in about ten minutes around one hundred and fifty rounds were fired. Three older women were killed including a mother and a daughter just a day after the Mother’s Day. The new details released by police unveiled more about what happened in the nation’s latest mass shooting. Farmington police say the first shot came at 10:56 AM, at 11:02 AM police have found the suspect. And four minutes later, at 11:06 AM, the suspect was shot and an officer was down. Farmington police say, they fired sixteen total rounds, the suspect well over one hundred. Officers say at least one of the three guns was purchased illegally. A candle light vigil’s mayor spoke to the grieve stricken community. Family members have told investigators that the suspect may have some mental health issues. It’s also worth-noting that there are three high school graduations and there will be increased police presence at all of those events.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 05.12.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-05.12.23/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 May 2023 21:03:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-05.12.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin with breaking news and a guilty verdict in the trial of an Idaho mom accused of killing her two youngest children. The case gripped the nation and revolves around a doomsday cult, the apocalypse, and L.V.D’s belief that evil spirits have turned her kids into zombies. Well, a jury convicted V.D in the murders of sixteen-years-old T.R and seven-year-old J.V. She was also found guilty of conspiring to kill her husband’s first wife who she viewed as a romantic rival. Prosecutors called about sixty witnesses during the trial and presented evidence that included DNA, explicit text messages and Google searches. The defense? They didn’t call a single witness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;L.D showed no reaction as she was convicted for killing her own children, but a source close to the trial tells us she did react to her own attorney’s closing arguments. She was unhappy they tried to pivot and put the blame for the killings on her husband, C. The so-called Idaho doomsday mom learns her fate. It took less than seven hours for the jury to find L.V.D guilty on all charges including first degree murder of her two youngest children and conspiracy in the death of her husband C’s then-wife T. Family members were emotional after the verdict. This phone call was among the evidence, along with a hair matching L.V.D’s DNA found on the tape wrapped around J.J’s body. Prosecutors claimed she used her religion to justify the murders and funded her lifestyle with the kid’s social security checks and T’s life insurance. The defense rested without calling a single witness. They argue she fell victim to her cult-leader husband. V.D could face life behind bars when she is sentenced. Her husband, C, will be trialed separately in the coming months. He could face the death penalty if he’s convicted.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 05.13.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-05.13.23/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 May 2023 21:03:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-05.13.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We’ll bring you the latest on the migration situation at the southern border and across the country in a moment. First, this developing news, tonight, millions of Americans face weather extreme. What do we mean by that? A heat wave in the northwest, monsoon flooding in the southwest and the threat of tornadoes across the plains. The tornado threat was so real former President T canceled a rally schedule for tonight in Des Moines. Today in Texas, a twister left his damage in Laguna Heights near the border with Mexico. One person was killed, ten others hurt. Dozens twisters have touched down in four states over the last twenty-four hours. To the southern border now, where the surge of migrants, the B administration was braced for has not materialized. Still, tens of thousands of people are crowded in Mexico, hoping to enter the United States. Many arrived after perilous journeys only to find confusing new US asylum rules, balky technology and reinforced borders, this after Covid era border restrictions were lifted earlier this week.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 05.14.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-05.14.23/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 May 2023 21:03:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-05.14.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with President B’s new border strategy. The revised rules are under political attack from both the right and left. Law suits have been filed as a result, but so far, the administration’s latest move appear to have deterred the record might rush many had feared following the expiration of Title 42. Government data obtained by CBSN shows forty-two-thousand people on Saturday crossed the southern border, sixty-three hundred on Friday. That’s compared to these numbers before Title 42 expired Thursday just before midnight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immigration officials say despite the lack of a spike, the border is still seeing historically high migration levels. Homeland Security Secretary A.M says it’s too early to tell whether the number at the southern border have peaked. The B administration says it’s steps it has taken asylums, that’s led to the lower-than-expected numbers. Border Patrol is preparing to for daily migrant arrivals to increase to twelve to fourteen thousand a day. But the characterization of the situation along the southern border is split along political party lines. Some Republicans are criticizing the narrative and the administration. Texas Congressman T.G shot this cellphone video at a Customs and Border Patrol processing center in El Paso on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 05.11.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-05.11.23/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 May 2023 21:03:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-05.11.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with a crisis at the southern border. The clock is ticking as the pandemic-era rule, known as Title 42, is set expire in a matter of hours. The border patrol chief telling CBSN tonight sixty thousand migrants are waiting near the US-Mexico border in hopes of seeking asylum once the deadline passes. US Customs and Border Protection say they are beyond capacity from California to Texas and are currently holding around twenty-five thousand migrants at its facilities. And we’ve just learned from an administration official that thousands of migrants were expelled today. Some flown out of the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behind me it’s one spot along the border where migrants, some of them have managed to make their way to the northern and turn themselves in to border patrol agents. As you mentioned, the border patrol chief told us he is aware of sixteen thousand migrants on the other side in northern Mexico. But he says they were prepared for whatever the decisions they might make. Tonight, with just hours to go before the official end of Title 42, border authorities are preparing for an influx of migrants since Monday. Roughly thirty thousand migrants have been apprehended. The B administration has proposed new immigration policies, such as restricting migrants from seeking asylum in the US if they haven’t applied for it in another country, like Mexico, penalties like banishment for up to five years for those who try to go outside the asylum process. Those who are allowed to seek asylum here will be tracked by GPS and have home curfews. Still, Republican critics say the administration immigration plans are not enough. Along other stretches of the Texas border, those processed continue their journey to the US.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 05.10.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-05.10.23/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 May 2023 22:31:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-05.10.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with a criminal probe within the halls of Congress that could have major consequences for control of the House. Embattled Congressman G.S pleaded not guilty today to a thirteen-count federal indictment in a New York courtroom. The litany of charges includes fraud and money laundering, linked to the New York Republican’s 2022 political campaign. He has previously admitted to lying about his resume, his family, and his religion. The first-term Congressman is following the D.T playbook by calling the prosecution a witch hunt. More than a dozen of his fellow Republicans in Congress have called on S to resign and the Speaker of the House isn’t going that far. But this just in, K.M says he will not back S for reelection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors says S relied on repeated dishonesty and deception to get elected and to enrich himself. And today, S met those allegations with that same defiance that he has been showing since it was first revealed he fabricated much of his resume and background. Chased by reporters and cameras outside a Long Island courtroom, G.S used the spotlight to launch his criminal defense. S was released on bond, after pleading not guilty to charges of fraud, money laundering and making false statements with his 2022 congressional campaign. In a thirteen-count indictment, prosecutors detailed an alleged scheme by S to solicit funds from donors who believed they were contributing to his campaign. Instead, they say, S spent the money on personal expenses, including luxury items like designer clothes and credit card payments. They said, S lied about his income and his assets on these candidate disclosure form. S said those prosecutors don’t have all the evidence. Prosecutors also accused S of falsely claiming thousands of dollars in pandemic unemployment benefits while they say he was actually making six figures working at a Florida-based investment firm. Today, House Speaker K.M said S is innocent until proven guilty. S said he would return to work in Washington.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 05.09.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-05.09.23/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 May 2023 20:43:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-05.09.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin with breaking news of verdicts in the civil rape and defamation trial of former President D.T. A federal jury in New York found D.T liable for sexually abusing advice columnist E.C nearly thirty years ago. The jury also found former President liable for defaming C when he denied the allegations and said she was lying to get publicity for her book. The former writer for Elle was awarded $5 million dollars in damages. The trial saw C testify in graphic detail about the assault inside a luxury department store dressing room in the 1990s. The jury was also shown a videotaped deposition of T being questioned under oath about the allegations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E.C appeared tonight as the jury’s verdict was read. It was an emotional nine-day trial. And in a statement, C called the verdict a victory, not just for her but democracy and sexual assault survivors everywhere. Writer E.C walked out of court saying very little, but the jury’s verdict spoke volumes. After just under three hours of deliberations, the jury of six men and three women found T liable for one count of battery and one count of defamation. It awarded C $2 million dollars for abuse and about $3 million for defamation. C had accused T of raping her in a New York apartment store dressing room in the mid-90s. She first went public with her claim in her 2019 memoir. T demoed the accusation calling it a hoax. During the trial, C gave a graphic testimony. She told jurors, “I’m here because D.T raped me, and when I wrote about it, he said it didn’t happen. He shattered my reputation”. T waived his right to testify, and the defense called no witnesses. Outside the courthouse, his lawyer J.T, said the deck was stacked against his client. But during the trial, jurors heard parts of T’s deposition in the case. He misidentified C in the photograph as his second wife M.M. And was asked about that infamous Access Hollywood reporting.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 05.08.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-05.08.23/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 May 2023 22:24:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-05.08.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We want to begin with another community reeling from one of the nation’s latest mass shootings. This time, it was in the Dallas suburb of Allen, Texas, the routine weekend activity of shopping as a family shattered by a gunman’s rampage. At least eight people were killed including three children. Seven others were injured. We want to take a moment to remember the victims. Investigators haven’t revealed the motive. But the ADL says that the thirty-three-year-old shooter embraced anti-Semitism, violent misogyny and white supremacy. And tonight, we are learning the shooter had heavy firepower, seven guns with him, two on him and five in his car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the shooter’s violent and racist views, investigators haven’t said for sure if that was the motivation for the attack. We also talked to survivors who describe what it was like trying to save victims who were dying. Saturday, just after 3:30 PM, a grey car drives up to the Allen Premium Outlets Mall. The door opens, and the shooters immediately starts firing dozens of rounds at shoppers from an AR-style rifle. The gunman only stops when a police officer, who happened to be at the mall, shoots and kills him. Police have identified him as thirty-three-year-old M.G. CBSN has learned he enlisted in the army in 2008 but did not finish basic training and was terminated after three months due to physical or mental conditions. G later worked as an armed and licensed security guard and passed a background check. This video shows the chaos and reality of a mass shooting for survivors. The memorial for the victims behind me keeps growing as people come by to stop, mourn and prey. There are two more vigils tomorrow for the victims.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 05.07.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-05.07.23/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 May 2023 20:19:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-05.07.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;It’s been another violent weekend in America. The worst of it in two Texas communities. We begin in the Dallas suburb of Allen where a gunman killed at least eight people Saturday, some of them children. CBS station KTVT identifies the gunman as thirty-three-year-old M.G. He was staying at a nearby motel and later killed at the scene. Today, to honor the victims, President B ordered flags flown at half-staff at federal buildings. He denounced the violence as senseless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mourners have set up a makeshift memorial behind me at the mall, while this small community just north of Dallas tries to make sense of this senseless attack. Crosses and carnations were placed outside the outlet mall today after a shooter opened fire Saturday, killing at least eight people at a suburban Dallas shopping center. The gunfire set customers running for cover. Dashcam video showed the shooter drive up in a grey car open the door and take aim at shoppers. Police say the man was wearing body armor. Witnesses say they heard the gunman fire dozens of shots. As people took cover, an Allen, Texas police officer already at the mall on an unrelated call, confronted the gunman, according to Allen, Texas police chief, B.H. Seven others were injured and remain in area hospitals. S.S race to the scene to help after his son told him about the shooting. S says he tried to help several people, including a child, but the little girl was dead. The Allen Premium Outlet mall was packed with shoppers getting ready for summer. Now the affluent suburb is hurting after being added to the growing list of American cities that were the site of the latest mass shooting.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 05.05.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-05.05.23/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 May 2023 20:54:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-05.05.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We’ll get to those details of those major drug bus targeting fentanyl in just a moment. The DEA revealing today it has arrested more than three thousand people. But we want to begin tonight with news about economy. Job growth in the US last month shattered expectations. The Labor Department says employers added two hundred fifty-three thousand jobs in April, while the unemployment rate sank to 3.4%, that’s a fifty-four-year-low. The report shows that the economy remains strong despite the Federal Reserve’s aggressive actions on interest rate hikes and worries about the debt limit showdown here in Washington.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The labor market continues to defy expectations. Job growth in April blew away estimates and led to the lowest unemployment rate since the 1960s. I think we’re making real progress. Hourly wages also were up higher than expected. April saw the largest monthly gain in more than a year. Those higher wages are helping fill jobs. Starting pay for lifeguards in Minneapolis went from $11 to $19 an hour. Adding those fears? The potential failure to raise the country’s borrowing limit by June 1st, which could lead to economic calamity. Today, President B attacks Republicans for trying to extract billions of dollars in cuts in order to raise the limit. But Republicans argue there is no better time to talk about cutting spending when you have got to raise the debt limit. The president is set to meet with top congressional leaders here at the White House next Tuesday to try to hammer out a deal with just under four weeks until, the Treasury Secretary says, the country will be unable to pay its bills.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 05.04.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-05.04.23/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 May 2023 18:52:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-05.04.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We want to begin with some breaking news right here in Washington with one of the most serious cases to come out of January 6th attack on the US Capitol. Four members of far-right extremist the Proud Boys including its former President were found guilty of numerous felonies including seditious conspiracy. A federal jury convicted the four of plotting the attack on the Capitol as part of its bid to keep D.T in the White House and prevent the peaceful transfer of power to then elected J.B. They each face decades in prison. The convictions are seen as a major victory of the Department of Justice as part of largest criminal investigation in American history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the longest and largest trial to emerge from January 6th for four months. Prosecutors put members of far-right Proud Boys front in center that day, saying they did so in defense of a president they wanted to keep in office even it meant violence. It was one of the darkest days in American history. And federal prosecutors cast the five Proud Boys as leaders of the mob responsible assembling a fighting force of one hundred members that considered themselves D.T’s army. Marching straight to the Capitol that morning is then-president T was speaking, some of them the first to break through police barricades. The jury convicted four of the five, including former one-time leader E.T of seditious conspiracy, plotting to overthrow the government and several other charges. The fifth D.P, who used a police riot shield to smash a Capitol window and lead rioters inside was convicted of obstructing an official proceeding. T, a one-time aide to T ally R.S was found guilty even though he wasn&amp;rsquo;t even in Washington on the 6th, directing his colleagues remotely from a Baltimore hotel. That night he messaged them, &amp;ldquo;Make no mistake, we did this&amp;rdquo;. Legally experts say T&amp;rsquo;s conviction in particular will impact Special Counsel J.S&amp;rsquo;s probe into D.T.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 05.03.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-05.03.23/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 May 2023 20:23:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-05.03.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;And we begin tonight with breaking news. The suspect accused of opening fire inside a medical center in Atlanta has been found. One person was killed and four others injured after they were shot in a waiting room. All of the victims are women, ranging in age from twenty-five to seventy-one years old. Police have identified the alleged shooter as twenty-four-year-old D.P. Here’s what we are learning about what happened. Sources tell CBSN that P became agitated while waiting for a medical appointment and he took out a handgun and immediately starting shooting. The coast guard veteran was with his mom. A law enforcement says P was on medication for mental health issues. According to the gun violence archives, this is the one hundred and ninetieth mass shooting in United States this year. Just remainder, today is just one hundred twenty third day of 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manhunt update: Police now have a suspect in custody nearly eight hours after an office shooting shut down a swath of a major American city. Midday mayhem in midtown Atlanta. Gun fire in a medical office waiting room. All five people shot were women. A thirty-nine-year-old victim died at the scene, three others critically wounded. This is twenty-four-year-old D.P, a coast guard and the shooting suspect. Police believe he disappeared after carjacking someone and sped off. But late today, a break in the case. Police closed in, P was arrested. Police spotted P in the back of a gated community in a county just northwest of Atlanta. This city is relieved.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 05.02.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-05.02.23/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 May 2023 20:00:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-05.02.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin with news that the B administration is sending fifteen hundred more active-duty troops, marines and Army to the southern border. That’s an addition to the twenty-five hundred national guard members already there. The decisions come ahead of an expected surge of migrants when pandemic-era restrictions, known as Title 42, expire next week. The Pentagon says the troops will not do law-enforcement duties, although some will be armed. The goal is to free up Border Patrol agents to do their jobs. Under Title 42, law enforcement was given broad authority to turn away hundreds of thousands of people including those seeking asylum on public health grounds. Well, once it expires next week, thousands more are expected to begin arriving every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The B administration says smugglers are already taking advantage ahead of the policy change, promising migrants easier entry to the US and making the expected surge even worse. Republicans say the crisis is already here. With thousands of migrants arriving at the southern border each day and that number is expected to rise, some of the fifteen hundred troops could in place as early as next Wednesday just one day before Title 42 is lifted. The soldiers will provide logistical support for ninety days. They will not be processing migrants, and some will be armed for self-defense purposes. The administration is preparing for as many as ten thousand migrants to cross the southern border next week, which could almost double the daily average in March. Recently, more than seven thousand migrants have arrived every day.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 05.01.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-05.01.23/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 May 2023 19:41:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-05.01.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We want to begin tonight with some breaking news. At least six people are dead and dozens more injured after massive pileup on Interstate fifty-five in South Central Illinois. Police say dozens of passenger vehicles and thirty commercial vehicles, including several semi-trucks were involved in a devastating crash located about seventy-five miles. Parts of the interstate are shut down in both directions after vehicles burst into flames following the collisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A rare dust storms this morning turned deadly after blinded cars and trucks along the central Illinois highway slammed into each other. Strong winds blew dirt from nearby farms across the highway, creating near-zero visibility that led to accidents on both the north and southbound sides. Smashed-up vehicles, some on fire and smoking, littered the highway for two miles. More than thirty people were taken into the hospitals. Up to ninety vehicles were involved. Two truck tractor semi-trailers have caught fire as a result of the crash. Now I can tell you that you can still clearly see and feel the wind that caused this accident. They have been moving semis off the interstate. Injuries in this accident ranging from minor to life-threatening, with the victims as young as two and as old as eighty. This portion of Interstate Fifty-five shut down for at least the rest of the evening.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 04.30.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-04.30.23/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 May 2023 20:57:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-04.30.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with the intensifying manhunt in Texas for the suspect accused of killing five of his neighbors ages eight to thirty-one years old. This afternoon, the FBI announced an eighty thousand dollars reward for information leading to the arrest of this man, thirty-eight-year-old F.O. The shooting happened in Cleveland, Texas, a rural community about forty-five miles north of Houston.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authorities just finished a press conference here where they announced that rewarded and said that they have no idea where the suspect is. It has been almost two days since this incident happened. And tonight, he remained elusive. A widening search tonight for the man suspected of murdering five people. Law enforcement says almost execution style in his Cleveland, Texas home. Investigators say thirty-eight-year-old F.O has left the nearby wooded area that they searched on Saturday. Sheriff’s deputies say the deadly rampage started late Friday night. The suspect’s neighbor W.G asked him to stop firing his gun in his yard so they could put a baby to sleep. After that talk with his neighbor, investigators say O who had been drinking, took an AR-style rifle, entered his neighbor’s home and started firing. Ten people were shot. Five were killed, the youngest, an eight-year-old boy. The Sheriff says two female victims were found on top of children, perhaps trying to protect them. O fled the scene, while authorities believe they have his rifle. They say he should be considered armed and extremely dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 04.29.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-04.29.23/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Apr 2023 19:10:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-04.29.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with a manhunt happening right now in Texas. Police searching for the gunman who killed five people, in their words, execution style. This happened late Friday in Cleveland, Texas, about forty-five miles north of Houston. It apparently began as a dispute among neighbors. Among the victims, an eight-year-old boy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Police said the suspect used an AR-style rifle and remains on the run. Investigators are describing him as highly dangerous. Officers on the ground, aided by drones and helicopter today launched an intense search for the suspected gunman. Thirty-eight-year-old F.O. Authorities say the shooting rampage began just after 11:30 Friday night. A Honduran family trying to put a young child to bed ask their neighbor, O, to stop firing his gun. Instead, police say, he turned it on them. At least ten people inside the home were hit by bullets. Five died, including an eight-year-old boy. The sheriff says the female victims died trying to protect children. Police sources tell us the suspect was drinking at the night of shooting. Investigators describe him as a Mexican citizen who has been deported twice before.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 04.28.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-04.28.23/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Apr 2023 22:38:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-04.28.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We want to begin with the tens of millions of Americans in the path of severe weather moving across the south with Texas facing the highest risks of dangerous storms. Tornado warnings and watches have been issued for central parts of the Lone Star State. Heavy rains, hail, and tornadoes are possible through the evening. Today’s threat comes less than twenty-four hours after multiple tornadoes touched down in Georgia and Florida ripping roofs off homes and uprooting trees. Further in the north and west, more than a million people are under flood warnings with the mighty Mississippi River expected to crest this weekend above twenty feet in some areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;April showers bring May flowers. But this week in the south, they also brought twisters and baseball size hail. Another round of severe storms is rolling through the south tonight with rain, hail and possible tornadoes spotted in north and central Texas. At least three tornadoes pounded the Florida panhandle on Thursday. In Panama City Beach, twisters damaged several homes and splintered trees, while pelting the area with golf ball-sized hail. Near Tallahassee, the storm dropped heavy rain making driving nearly impossible. It’s the same system that produced supercell storms earlier this week that sent giant hailstones raining down on parts of Texas. Even this bull had to run for cover.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 04.26.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-04.26.23/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Apr 2023 19:53:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-04.26.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We want to begin with the severe weather that is making its way across the southern part of the country. While residents along the Mississippi river are forced to evacuate ahead of rising floodwaters. Nearly twenty-two million Americans from central Texas to the Florida Peninsula are in the path of significant storms, including heavy rains damaging winds, and possible tornadoes. Further north, in five states across the Midwest, spring snowmelt is leading some of the worst flooding along the Mississippi River in more than twenty years. Communities in Minnesota, Iowa and Wisconsin are busy filling sandbags as water levels are nearing all time records and are still rising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Texas governor isn’t taking any chances. He activated state emergency response crews as severe weather hammers Texas. Tonight, the Lone Star State is getting slammed again but severe storms. In West Texas, the National Weather Service is surveying the overnight storm damage east of Lubbock. Powerful thunderstorms brough baseball size hail and winds up to ninety miles per hour smashing windows and denting car roofs. It was a similar story for residents in central Florida yesterday. A rare blanket of hail turning yards into layers of ice. To the north, it’s a wet and soggy mess. From north to south, melting snow has triggered flood warnings all along the Mississippi river. In the town of Wabasha, Minnesota, streets are under water. Melting snow in the Sierra Nevada has communities in California bracing for major flooding, brought on by near-record warm temperature. And Yosemite National Park will be off-limits to visitors starting Friday with temperature expected to be fifteen degrees above normal, leading to dangerous flooding.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 04.27.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-04.27.23/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Apr 2023 19:53:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-04.27.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We want to begin tonight with some breaking news here in Washington. CBSN has confirmed that former Vice President M.P appeared before a grand jury investigating efforts to overturn the 2020 election. P testified for more than seven hours about the events leading up to the January 6th attack on the US Capitol. Special Counsel, J.S want to know about P’s conversations with former President D.T and T’s alleged role in plans to block congressional certification of President-elect J.B’s election victory. A federal appeals court on Wednesday rejected T’s last-minute bid to try and block P’s testimony. Former President M.P at the center of the storm before and during the Capitol attack. And today, sources told CBSN he came prepared to tell the truth within certain legal bounds about what really happened behind the scenes in that relentless effort to get him to stop the B presidency. Special Counsel, J.S, got his special star witness today, former Vice President M.P, whose appearance before the grand jury was one former President D.T repeatedly try to block. P’s SUV left the DC court house this evening after his lengthy session with investigators. T signed an executive wanted to stop P from sharing details about the days leading up to the January 6th attack and T’s pressure campaign to overturn the 2020 election. T leaned into P privately and publicly on January 6th. P’s refusal to block the certification of the election infuriated T. Now, with P moving closer to entering the race for the White House, his testimony today could affect the legal and political fate of his potential rival.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 04.25.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-04.25.23/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Apr 2023 19:53:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-04.25.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We want to begin with some breaking news. Senior administration officials tell CBSN that the ISIS leader behind the 2021 suicide bombing at the Kabul airport has been killed. Thirteen US service members died in the attack and forty-five others were injured. At least one hundred and seventy Afghans were also killed. The White House did not release the name but describe the senior Islamic leader as the mastermind of the assault. It happened at an airport entrance known as Abbey Gate, where people were gathering, hoping to get out of Afghanistan with the help of US troops. The deadly attack occurred during the chaotic withdrawal and it is considered one of the darkest moment of B’s presidency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A measure of justice for the thirteen American servicemen and women killed by a suicide bomber during the chaotic evacuation of Afghanistan. The mastermind behind that attacked was killed by Taliban. It happened earlier this month in fighting between the Taliban and ISIS. The bomb carved a path of death destruction through the crowd, wounding forty-five other servicemen and women and killing at least one hundred and seventy Afghan civilians.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 04.24.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-04.24.23/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Apr 2023 19:53:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-04.24.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We want to begin tonight with a major shake up in the media landscape as the most watched cable network, the conservative Fox News has abruptly parted ways with its top-rated anchor T.C. The stunning news could ripple through American politics as T.C is considered one of the most influential voices in the Republican party. And it comes just six days after Fox agreed to pay nearly eight hundred million dollars for making false claims about Dominion Voting Systems. C is at the center of the false rigging claims following the 2020 election as well as a new discrimination lawsuit filed by a former producer for alleging a hostile and discriminatory work environment. Shares of Fox Corporation dropped 3% on the news. And CNN has fired its longtime host D.L after seventeen years at the network. The embattled morning show co-host faced backlash after saying women in their fifties were past their prime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C’s controversial comments over the years led many advertisers to flee at times. But some of his rhetoric would have obviously got him fired at many media companies but his rating soared, which brought Fox News a lot of money and brought him more air time until now. That was T.C, signing off on Friday. This morning, the highest rated prime time anchor at Fox News was told he was leaving the network according to the New York Times. Fox made the announcement on air and noted in a statement that his last show was Friday. There was no comment from C. The LA Times reported Fox Corporation CEO R.M personally made the call to oust C. He is currently involved in a lawsuit filed by his former senior producer A.G. C’s departure comes less than a week after Fox agreed to settle a historic defamation lawsuit with Dominion Voting Systems for over seven hundred eighty-seven million dollars. Text messages revealed in court documents show C privately criticizing Fox guests former President D.T and one directed at Fox management that said “those efforts are destroying our credibility”. Murdoch was also reportedly upset with C’s coverage on the Jan 6th attack. He claimed it was provoked by government agents. The fifty-three-old has gone relatively unchecked for years, making controversial comments about race and immigration.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 04.23.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-04.23.23/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Apr 2023 19:53:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-04.23.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;New details are emerging tonight about the daring evacuation of nearly one hundred US diplomatic personnel and their families from Sudan’s capital, Khartoum. It was carried out by US special forces as two top generals and their soldiers battle for control of the country. The violence has paralyzed nation’s airports and claimed more than four hundred lives. Thousands of Americans, many of them dual citizens, remained caught in the crossfire. The mission began on Saturday. Three Chinook helicopters flew from Djibouti refueled in Ethiopia, then landed in Sudan’s capital, Khartoum. After returning to Djibouti, the Americans were then flown to the US military base in Ramstein, Germany. US Secretary of State A.B monitored the evacuation in Washington.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the evacuation of US embassy staff and their families has only intensified concern for the estimated sixteen thousand Americans who still remain trapped in Sudan as the fighting there becomes even deadlier. Heavily armed fighters from the feared Rapid Support Force paramilitary group raced towards Khartoum as the battle for the capital city now in its second week shows no sign of ending. Despite intense international pressure for a ceasefire, the RSF’s leader, general M.H.D remains locked in a bitter power struggle with his arch rival, general A.F, Sudan’s top military chief. At least four hundred people have been killed and thousands more wounded in the fighting. The fear now is Africa’s third largest country is falling into civil war, a war that could trigger humanitarian catastrophe on the scale not seen in decades. Sudan has large oil and gold deposits, a strategically located port and neighbors East Africa’s most powerful nations, but has been political unstable following the 2019 pro-democracy crisis that led to the toppling of military dictator O.B. Both B and H served under and seized power in a 2021 military coup, with promises of leading Sudan towards democratic civilian rule, but have instead turned their best army against each other, civilians caught in the crossfire.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 04.22.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-04.22.23/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Apr 2023 19:53:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-04.22.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin with Sudan as the fighting between rival forces enters its second week. Thousands of American citizens are caught in the crossfire between opposing factions of the country’s military. This is the capital Khartoum. Gunfire today echoing through its streets. A planned ceasefire so far failing to stop the fighting. Tonight, several countries are planning emergency evacuations of their diplomats including the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite repeatedly calls for a ceasefire to coincide with the start of Eid holiday, the fighting between the two warring Sudanese generals is only intensifying. The sound of gunfire crackles across Khartoum as thick black smoke billows above the Sudanese capital. After a week of intense fighting, the city’s main hospitals are at breaking point. Medicines were running out, electricity is in short supply and more wounded are arriving desperate for help. It’s now a race against time to evacuate foreign diplomats from the city. These Saudi nationals are among the first to flee Sudan as they stepped off an apparent evacuation ship at the Saudi port of Jeddah. Sudan’s military Chief and President A.F.B has also announced the evacuation process for several other countries, including the US as forces loyal to Burhan remain locked in an increasingly violent power struggle with M.H.D, Sudan’s Vice President and commander of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces. Over the past week, more than four hundred people have been killed in the fighting, including an American citizen.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 04.21.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-04.21.23/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Apr 2023 19:53:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-04.21.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We do begin tonight with breaking news the Supreme Court just issued a decision that will allow access to the common abortion drug, mifepristone while the legal process continues. The justices granted an emergency access from the B administration and the drug maker after a US District judge revoked the FDA’s twenty-three-year-old approval to the drug. Mifepristone is a medication that has been used by millions of American women since it was approved in 2000. It was approved for use through ten weeks of pregnancy and it is also commonly prescribed to treat miscarriages. More than half of all abortions in the United States use medication. This is the first major action by the nation’s highest court related to abortion rights since it overturned R.V.W last summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a brief, unsigned order the court issued today that blocked those lower court rulings, which means the pill will be available now nationwide through the next few months while these appeals kind of play out. Two of the nine justices conservative Justice S.A and C.T had dissented here. But there were no other noted dissented. Obviously, I think this was the expected outcome. There are conservative legal principles at the heart of this case that suggested this court is not going to allow a lower court judge to ban a drug that the FDA approved more than two decades ago. But, in the meantime, for that fear, states had already been stockpiling drugs, worried that the court might take a different course.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 04.20.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-04.20.23/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Apr 2023 19:53:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-04.20.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, we want to begin with the dangerous weather that is sweeping across the nation after nearly a dozen tornadoes tore through Oklahoma, Kansas and Iowa on Wednesday. More than forty million Americans from the South to the Midwest are in the path of the thunderstorms, hail, and more possible tornadoes through the night. At least two people were killed in Oklahoma where authorities are still assessing damage that left thousands without power. And the images just coming in show twisters flattened homes while trees were ripped up by the roots and scattered across the roadways. The sheriff’s office in McLean County, that’s just south of Oklahoma City, says dozens of residents suffered injuries during the height of the storm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The family that was here is lucky to be alive. Take a look at some of this damage. The roof, it’s gone. Walls are blown out. One of the survivors here said that the sound of this house ripping apart at the seams is one of the scariest things he’s ever heard. It is definitely violent. Powerful storms tore through the South and Midwest and pounded the country’s mid-section with violent tornadoes and hail. More than a dozen tornadoes were reported yesterday in Kansas, Iowa and Oklahoma. At least three people were killed in the center state, two near the small town of Cole, about thirty miles south of Oklahoma City. Today, Governor K.S toured the town of Shawnee where storms tore down powerlines.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 04.18.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-04.18.23/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Apr 2023 19:53:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-04.18.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with some breaking news of the most consequential media trial in decades. The 1.6-billion-dollar defamation case against Fox News. Late this afternoon, the judge announced the settlement was reached between Dominion Voting Systems and the cable media giant. The CEO of the voting machine company says Fox has admitted to telling lies about Dominion and has agreed to pay nearly eight hundred million dollars to settle the case. Fox said in a statement quote “We acknowledge the court’s rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false.” That’s not a direct admission of guilt but Fox is seeking to avoid the embarrassment and the media circus of having its top stars and executives appears on the witness stand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a true last-minute settlement. Just after opening statements were set to begin, Judge E.D announced that the court, the parties have resolved their case. A blockbuster settlement averting a potentially landmark trial. Lawyers Dominion Voting Systems celebrated their settlement with Fox News this afternoon, announcing that the company would pay Dominion more than seven-hundred-eighty-seven-million dollars. Dominion had been seeking 1.6 billion dollars in damages from Fox for defamation, arguing the company knew the claims of election fraud aired by their guests and some of their hosts were false and aired them anyway, damaging Dominion’s reputation and business in the process. Attorney for Fox left the courthouse without comment. In the statement, the company did not apologize, though they acknowledged the court found some of Fox’s claims about Dominion to be false. With the settlement, Fox News now avoids a six-week trial. Dominion’s attorney wouldn’t say whether there was anything else in the settlement besides money.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 04.19.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-04.19.23/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Apr 2023 19:53:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-04.19.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, we want to begin right here in Washington where the Supreme Court has given itself until the end of the week to decide whether the abortion pill that has been used by millions of American women should remain available nationwide. Justice S.A has pushed the decision until midnight on Friday. At issue, a lower court ruling that rolled back the Food and Drug Administration’s twenty-three-year-old approval of Mifepristone. About hall of all abortions in the United States are medication abortions. The drug is also commonly prescribed by doctors to miscarriages. It is approved for use through 10 weeks of pregnancy. Friday’s decision will be the first major court action related to abortion since it overturned R.V.W in June of last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The justices were expected to announce by midnight tonight whether they were going to continue blocking these court rulings and keep this pill available nationwide. The court gave no explanation for why it’s decided now to push that back until Friday. In two brief orders, Justice S.A extended the deadline keeping the abortion pill Mifepristone available nationwide at least two more days. The B administration and a drug manufacturer have asked the justices to step in and set aside or block lower court rulings that would ban or greatly restrict the pill. The case is an effort by a conservative legal group in Texas to limit abortion nationwide, arguing the FDA didn’t properly approve Mifepristone more than twenty years ago. Federal Judge M.K, a T appointee sided with the challengers and revoked the FDA’s authorization. An appeals court said K went too far, but it kept some restrictions in place, saying Mifepristone could only be used for abortion up to seven weeks, despite FDA approval of ten weeks and requiring three visits to a doctor. The administration is arguing that one federal judge cannot set abortion policy nationwide. Now there are conservative legal principles at the heart of this case on standing that suggests the justices are going to continue to block these lower court rulings indefinitely.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 04.16.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-04.16.23/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Apr 2023 09:10:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-04.16.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with another mass shooting in America. It is the thirty-second so far this month and the nineth of the weekend. It happened here at a dance hall in Dadeville, Alabama. It’s a community about sixty miles Northeast of Montgomery. At least four people were killed, about two dozen injured, mostly teens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alabama investigators are looking into reports that first there was an argument and then gunshots. It was all part of another crime blotter weekend of gun killings. Dadeville, Alabama, targeted by mindless gun violence. Inside this dance hall, gunshots ran out. A Sweet sixteen party became a mass murder scene. Louisville, Kentucky also grieving. On Saturday night, at least one shooter fired into a crowd of hundreds in a city park. Two people fell dead, four more wounded. And a community still reeling from last week’s bank massacre. This American frontline never seems to go away. What to do about gun violence? Our new CBSN poll shows roughly three in four Americans believe mass shootings are preventable. Sixty-two percent want to ban the AR-15 semi-automatic rifle. But that idea is DOA at the NRA. At its annual convention this weekend in Indianapolis, one 2024 Republican presidential candidate after another championed the Second Amendment. Just three weeks ago, six people died during a mass shooting at a Nashville Christian School, seventy-seven percent of parents told us gun violence worries them. But what about fewer guns or no guns? Eighty-one percent of Liberals say America would be safer, and twenty-five percent of conservatives. Roughly one in five Americans report a shooting death in the family.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 04.17.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-04.17.23/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Apr 2023 20:53:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-04.17.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin with another community in mourning tonight, shattered after a mass shooting as at a sweet sixteen party. Four people were killed. Their ages range from seventeen to twenty-three. Two of them were high school seniors. Tonight, we speak to the mother of a hometown hero who had just signed to play football in college. At least thirty-two others were injured and several are in critical condition when gunfire turned a birthday party into a nightmare in the small town of Dadeville, Alabama on Sunday. Authorities say they have strong leads but have not released anything about a motive or possible suspects. And it comes as a new CBS poll shows seventy-seven percent of parents are concerned about gun violence and as guns have surpassed car accidents as the leading cause of death for children in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Police are still very tight-lipped about this investigation. But the girl who had the sweet sixteen party at this venue behind me told me that there were rumors that someone may have had a gun. Well, that prompted her mother to stop the party, turn the lights on, and tell everyone inside if you are over eighteen and you have gun, you need to leave. Later that night, the unthinkable happened.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 04.15.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-04.15.23/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Apr 2023 19:32:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-04.15.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with new details on the leak of classified Pentagon documents. The suspected leaker, a twenty-one-year-old Junior Air National Guardsman from Massachusetts remains jailed this weekend. His next court appearance? Wednesday. The Pentagon describes the leak as a serious risk to national security. The President B says he is quote “not concerned” about what was leaked but rather that it happened. He returned home to Delaware early this morning after a trip to the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before he left Ireland, the president told reporters that he expects the investigation to wrap up quickly as we learned new details about what was in those documents. President B wants the Pentagon to find out how it happened. Twenty-one-year-old Air National Guardsman J.T appeared before a federal judge Friday, but he did not enter a plea to the Espionage Act violation against him. The leak of classified documents apparently went undetected for months. The incident has put the B administration in damage control, restricting access to the nation’s most guarded secrets. They appeared to reveal US surveillance of enemies and allies. The Washington post reports some of the leaked pages included intelligence on at least four more Chinese spy balloons. Today in Vietnam, Secretary of State A.B insisted relations with allies has not been impacted by the leak.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 04.14.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-04.14.23/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Apr 2023 19:38:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-04.14.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We want to begin with new details in the arrest of a Massachusetts Air National Guardsman in one of the worst breaches of classified intelligence documents in years. Tonight, twenty-one-year-old J.T remains in jail until his next court hearing on Wednesday. He did not enter a plea in a federal courtroom in Boston today, where he was officially charged with unauthorized removal, retention, and transmission of classified or national defense information under the Espionage Act. Well, today, we learned from the charging documents that authorities accused T of knowing exactly what he was doing. He was even searching online to see if authorities were on to him as the leaker. T started to posting what appeared to be classified documents in an online gaming chat platform as early as December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Court documents allege the twenty-one-year-old, gamer and International Air Guardsman actually searched his own government computer for the word leak, apparently concerned investigators may have identified the source. As the charges were read in a Boston courtroom, twenty-one-year-old J.T stood silently. Arrested Thursday by heavily armed federal agents outside his mother’s Massachusetts home. T now charged under the Espionage Act. Federal investigators accused him of posting dozens of images bearing top secret markings to Discord, an online gaming platform. According to the criminal complaint, T did cyber defense operations in the Air National Guard and required a top-secret security clearance that gave him access to some of the government’s most highly classified records known as SCI. Former Secretary of Defense M.E said internal criminal security system failed. Three days before T’s arrest, court records detailed how federal investigators questioned a user of that gaming platform. Among the first record posted, an intelligence status report about the war in Ukraine. Billing information revealed the username behind the post was the defendant who used his home address.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 04.13.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-04.13.23/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Apr 2023 19:51:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-04.13.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin with a stunning break in the investigation into the highest-profile US intelligence leak in years. The disclosure of Pentagon secrets about the war in Ukraine has reverberated across the world and caused international scandal. Under arrest tonight, a twenty-one-year-old Massachusetts Air National Guardsman named J.T and there are still so many questions. How did he have access to these top-secret documents? And what prompted him to allegedly post military documents in his obscure online chat group with teenagers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Boston station WBZ was there, capturing his arrest live, showing heavily armed federal officers taking the suspect into custody just this afternoon outside his mom’s home, about an hour south of Boston. Well, tonight, we’re also learning that journalists from New York Times had identified the alleged leaker from what called “a digital trail of evidence” including a granite countertop. The journalists were knocking on his door just moments before the FBI showed up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FBI has arrested the prime suspect, and just moments ago, the Secretary of Defense ordered an investigation into how the Pentagon handles its classified documents, some of which circulated for months in a chat group used by video gamers, some of them teenagers. The FBI put on a show of force to arrest twenty-one-year-old airman in the Massachusetts National Guard. He came out with his hands up in front of his childhood home in south Boston. Attorney General M.G announced the arrest. It came one week after the Pentagon first discovered some of its most highly classified documents posted on social media. Although the leak started last fall when secrets started showing up on a gaming platform called Discord. The Washington Post interviewed a teenage member of a small chat group on Discord who said the leaks began with text messages quoting from classified documents and then, when no one seemed impressed, photographs of the actual documents. Glimpses of what lay beneath the documents, a countertop and a kitchen floor matched photos of the inside T’s home, a digital trail which led the New York Times there ahead of the FBI.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 04.12.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-04.12.23/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Apr 2023 21:32:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-04.12.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, we want to begin as we’re learning more about that horrible massacre at a Louisville bank. We’re hearing from the family of the gunman for the first time saying they’ll fully cooperate with the investigators. They are also revealing that the shooter had mental health challenges which they said they were quote “actively addressing”. It comes the on the same day police released frantic 911 calls from inside the bank as employees hid pleading for help. In the background, you hear gunfire as police are engaging with the shooter. Also on those calls, his mother, in shock and disbelief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The community remembered the victims at a vigil here tonight with residents speaking through tears and calling for gun violence to end. It’s just hours since the police released those 911 calls. In them, you can feel the callers’ fear as they plead for police to act fast. The 911 calls are chilling, the first one from a woman who watched remotely on a video call as the shooter opened fire on a board meeting at the bank. Then a woman inside the bank called 911 cautiously, that she hides in a closet with another person. By the time, the shooter’s mother calls saying her son has never done anything violent and that he might be heading to the bank with a gun. Tonight, two people remain in the hospital, including police officer N.W, shot in the head as he responded to the shooting, he remains in critical condition. At a vigil in Louisville tonight, mourners honored the five people killed in the Monday shooting. All employees at the bank where the gunman worked. In a statement, the shooter’s family condemned what they called this senseless act of violence adding while he had mental health challenges, there were never any warning signs he was capable of shocking act. Funerals for at least two of the victims are set to take place on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 04.11.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-04.11.23/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Apr 2023 22:23:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-04.11.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We do want to begin with breaking news from Louisville, Kentucky where police just released chilling and disturbing body camera video showing officers responding to the deadly mass shooting inside a bank and taking out the killer.

In an emotional news conference today, the mayor of Louisville said his city is shaken, scarred, and angry. A surgeon spoke of his wariness from treating so many guns shot victims. For the victims inside the bank, a staggering one hundred and seventy units of blood were used to treat them. And we also learned today that AR-15 style rifle that was used in the attack, like all confiscated guns in Kentucky were likely be auctioned off the public and under current law, could eventually ended up back on the street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The police bodycam and bystander video show the harrowing moment as the first police officers arrived at the bank behind me to try to take down the shooter, seemingly waiting in the front lobby after killing coworkers in what police say was a targeted attack. Newly released bodycam footage shows officers confronting the gunman as they tried to enter the Louisville bank where he shot and killed coworkers. Just three minutes after the first calls cane into 911. He immediately shot officer N.W. Police say Officer C.G was shot head on and rolled down the steps. Cell phone video shows G taking cover trying to find a clear shot, before finally killing the shooter in the front lobby at the bank. Police have searched the shooter’s home and recovered several items but are still investigating his motive. The gunman killed five of his colleagues. As tributes to the victims grow, so is the feeling here that gun violence has to end. Louisville Mayor says forty people have already been killed by gun violence in the city this year.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 04.10.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-04.10.23/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Apr 2023 21:12:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-04.10.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, the city of Louisville, Kentucky is reeling after four people were killed and nine others wounded when a twenty-five-year-old gunman livestreaming the attack opened fire with a rifle inside the bank where he worked. Police showed up in just three minutes. He was killed in a shootout that has a rookie officer clinging to life. That officer shot in the head had been on force for just ten days. The four people killed today at the Old National Bank were between forty and sixty-four years old. One of those killed was a close friend of Kentucky Governor A.B who fought back tears and called all of the victims irreplaceable, amazing individuals. President B called the shooting senseless and once again urged the congress to take action on gun reform. We are not even one hundred days into the year and there have already been one hundred and forty-six mass shooting in this country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flags at all state buildings here in Kentucky are flying at half staff to honor the victims in day’s mass shooting. Police are trying to figure out why the gunman, who started working as an intern in 2018 at the bank behind me and who had a business degree turned violent, killing some of his colleagues. Calls to 911 started to coming in just after 8:30 this morning. Within three minutes, police officers arrived at the Old National Bank in downtown Louisville. Police say the suspect used an AR-15 style rifle and police immediately began to exchange gunfire. Louisville Metro Police have identified the gunman as twenty-five-year-old C.S, an employee at the bank. When it was over, four people were shot and killed, nine taken to nearby hospital including rookie officer N.W on the job just ten days who was shot in the head. Tonight, SWAT team and investigators are at the suspect’s home searching for motive.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 04.09.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-04.09.23/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Apr 2023 22:24:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-04.09.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Well, tonight, the B administration says it is considering all of its options after federal judge in Texas ignited a new national debate over abortion rights. His decision with suspend approval of a key abortion pill making the procedure harder to access even in states where it’s legal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, in addition to concerns about what the Texas judge’s decision could mean for women’s health, the B administration also says it undermines the FDA approval process which could impact other drugs that don’t have anything to do with abortion. The B administration is fighting back. Health and Human Services Secretary X.B is demanding the courts overturn a Texas judge’s ruling that would block access to the abortion pill Mifepristone, the medication used by women and more than half of all abortions across the country. Some Republicans also remain steadfast in their anti-abortion position despite losses in the midterms and in a recent Wisconsin Supreme Court race that virtually ensured that state’s abortion ban will be overturned.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 04.08.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-04.08.23/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Apr 2023 20:48:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-04.08.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, nine months after the Supreme Court overturned the America’s constitutional right for women to an abortion, providers are once again scrambling. At issue, use of a key abortion medication after two conflicting court opinions. Last night, a federal judge in Texas blocked the federal government’s decades old approval of Mifepristone, ruling it was not properly tested. But, another judge in Washington State ruled the pill is safe and should remain available in a swath of states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the B administration immediately filed a notice to appeal the Texas judge’s decision late last night. Now, the two competing rulings set up a high stakes legal showdown that’s likely to end up before the US Supreme Court. Federal Judge M.K ordered a hold on federal approval of Mifepristone, the most commonly used abortion drug. The B administration says the controversial ruling eliminates basic freedoms for women, putting their health at risk. The judge appointed by President T issued a sixty-seven-page opinion, asserting the FDA’s approval twenty-three years ago violated a federal rule because the drug wasn’t properly tested. The ruling could limit abortion access, even for women in states where the procedure is legal. Anti-abortion rights advocates are pleased with the decision. Federal Judge T.R appointed by President O blocked the FDA from making any changes to Mifepristone availability in seventeen Democrat led states and Washington DC that sued to expand access. Mifepristone is of two approved pills used in more than half of legal abortions in the country. The outcome in this case may undermine the FDA approval process, setting a damaging precedent.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 04.07.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-04.07.23/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Apr 2023 21:11:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-04.07.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, the two lawmakers who were expelled by their Republican colleagues following gun reform protests could soon be reinstated. And it comes as we witness the political fallout over the Tennessee Three. One state representative was spared by a single vote allowing her to keep her job. Tennessee is now at the center of the partisan over race and gun violence. Tonight, Vice President K.H is in Nashville to meet with the ousted lawmakers and push for legislation to address gun violence. We are also learning that President B just called the three and invited them to the White House. And today, we heard from former president B.O who says this is the latest examples of a broader erosion of Democratic norms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vice President H just went inside the chapel to behind me to meet with the three democratic politicians and their supporters. And this should make them happy. Former state representative J.J, apparently, won’t be out of work for long. Nashville city councilors are expected to name him interim state rep on Monday. Nashville, still a seething city today, reeling over Republican retribution for a Democratic breach of protocol, unseated not one state lawmaker, but two. A national firestorm sparked by this moment last week. Three disruptive Democratic lawmakers and one bullhorn, a legislative session gone off the trails. Their issue, stricter gun laws after a school shooting killed six people including three children. House Republicans pitched a fit, what they called disorder and dishonor became drama, disorder and defiance. Tennessee House Republicans tweeted this response to all their critics, “Unprecedented actions yield unprecedented consequences”.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 04.06.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-04.06.23/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Apr 2023 19:42:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-04.06.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We want to begin tonight with a political show down in the state of Tennessee. It’s getting national attention following the latest school shooting. Republicans tonight are voting to expel Democratic lawmakers from the Tennessee House of Representatives. This is an incredibly rare move in the Volunteer State. In fact, it’s only happened to eight lawmakers since the Civil War. Well, six of them were Confederate racists from the 19th century who refused to give former slaves citizenship. One was for a bribery conviction and another lawmaker was kicked out for allegations of sexual misconduct. Disorderly behavior for leading chants with gun control protesters from the House floor. State Representative J.J was the first to be expelled from his democratically elected position. He walked through a sea of supporters with his colleagues G.J and J.P, the Tennessee Three as they are known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This debate was barbed and bitter for hours, but had a surprise twist. Republicans expelled two Democratic lawmakers but spared one other involved in last week’s disturbance. And there was an air of vengeance from both sides. With the announcement, Tennessee’s State House contracted by one member, and America’s political divide widen. The day’s first target for Republicans, state representative J.J. No peace this moment last week. J, one of three Democrats with a bullhorn commandeering a legislative session, angry about last week’s slaughter of the innocents at Nashville’s Covenant School. The supermajority Republican members saw the trio as decorum shattering renegades, unfit to serve one more day. This moment is also a meditation on how political fractured America has become. Tennessee has expelled state lawmakers before, but this is the first time in state history that a lawmaker has been forced from his seat on partisan grounds.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 04.05.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-04.05.23/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Apr 2023 20:23:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-04.05.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin with a startling new development in the federal investigation of D.T that could mark a turning point. It comes after the former president launched a new round of attacks on the FBI and Justice Department, both at Mar-a-Lago last night and again today on Truth Social. Well, for months, the special counsel right here in Washington has waged a behind-the-scenes legal battle to get T’s closest advisors to testify. The president’s lawyers have tried to limit that testimony and they repeatedly failed. Yesterday, we learned T’s chief of staff will have testify. Today, we learned M.P is willing to answer questions under oath about then President T’s efforts to overturn 2020 Election. Legal experts say it’s this investigation could be much more damaging than what happened yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is extraordinary and potentially historic development, a former vice president now willing within certain bounds to testify about possible illegal acts by a president. An advisor to former President M.P says he could testify before the grand jury within weeks. And prosecutors could get a vivid firsthand account of what D.T did and said as he relentlessly pressured P to overturn the 2020 Election. Today, D.T called on congressional Republicans to defund the DOJ and FBI, a move dismissed even by his staunch ally, South Carolina Republican Senator L.G. At Tuesday’s New York arraignment Judge J.M warned against rhetoric that could inflame or cause civil unrest. But T later took the gloves off during a rally in Mar-a-Lago tearing into Manhattan DA A.B and Judge H personally. One day after, Judge B detailed the thirty-four count criminal indictment of T, accusing him of falsifying business records and part of a year long alleged hush money payment scheme. T’s lawyers say they will mount an aggressive effort to have the charge dismissed.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 04.04.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-04.04.23/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Apr 2023 21:10:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-04.04.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Former President D.J.T was arrested, booked, read his rights and the indictment against him unsealed, tonight, T addressing supporters for the first time from the ballroom at his Mar-a-Lago resort. The 49th president of the United States pleaded not guilty to thirty four felony counts of falsifying business records in the first degree. According to the indictment, the thirty four counts were part of an elaborate scheme to conceal crimes that damaging information from the voting public during the 2016 presidential election. They include claims by a doorman that T fathered a child out of wedlock now known to be not true, as well as hush money payments to hide sexual relationships with two different women including former porn star S.D. T denies the allegations and calls the investigation a witch hunt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A site unlike any in American history, a former president brought here to Manhattan to be criminally indicted. The prosecutor here accuses D.T of paying hush money to undermine the 2016 presidential election. A defiance stance from former President T as he left T Tower this morning, but after waving to supporters as he entered Manhattan Criminal Court surrendered to authorities, and briefly appeared before cameras. T looked noticeably somber. He had been arrested, the first formal criminal charges for any former president. There was reportedly no mugshot taken but he was fingerprinted and given a case number like any other defendant. Flanked by his lawyers inside the courtroom. T listened as the judge’s clerk read off the charges against him. Asked for a plea, the former president remained seated and said “not guilty”. He said nothing as he left the courtroom. T is charged with thirty-four felony counts of falsifying business records to conceal hush money payments to three individuals who were threatening to reveal negative information about him during the 2016 election.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 04.03.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-04.03.23/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Apr 2023 20:47:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-04.03.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, at this hour, D.T is meeting with his new legal team as he prepares to be the first former president to see the inside of the courtroom as a defendant. On Tuesday, he will travel down to lower Manhattan to surrender to the New York District Attorney. And tonight, we are wondering will there be cameras in the courtroom. T’s lawyer today opposing them, arguing it would create a circus-like atmosphere. We are also learning new details about the charges including at least one felony likely for falsifying business records, in the first degree. That felony charge would not prevent T from running for office once again. T was escorted by the Secret Service from his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida to his T Tower apartment in New York City. Crowds have gathered and security is tight, the entire NYPD on standby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A surreal and historic American scene today, a former president making his way to New York ahead of a criminal arraignment all as legal political uncertainty hover. Supporters cheered on former President D.T as a motorcade of black SUVs shuttled him to Palm Beach Airport, the beginning of a history-making trip that now finds T in legal jeopardy and the political spotlight. Once in New York, T made his way through a city on high alert, with protesters and police officers on the street. T is already on the attack ahead of his arraignment, claiming the judge overseeing the case, J.M, “hates me”, and calling the prosecution a witch hunt. Though the indictment is sealed until Tuesday, sources say T will likely be charged with falsifying business records in the first degree, a felony, stemming from his alleged in hush money paid to adult film star S.D back in 2016. M.C, a key witness for the prosecution, alleged T directed him to make the payment to D. C has served time in prison partly for his role in that exchange. On Tuesday, T will arrive at Manhattan Criminal Court for processing just before noon. He will be fingerprinted and may stand for a mug shot but he will not be handcuffed. At the 2:15 PM arraignment, judge is expected to outline the charges against T and ask for him to enter a plea. District Attorney A.B’s decision to indict stunned and angered T, but he has also capitalized on it. The campaign claims to raised over seven million dollars since. Republicans came to T’s defense this weekend, including potential competitors in the 2024 race. But other Republicans say T’s 2024 presidential campaign could now be vulnerable and at least one rival, former Arkansas Governor, A.H, jumped to the race Monday.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 04.02.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-04.02.23/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Apr 2023 21:03:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-04.02.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, New York City is bracing for what could be two tumultuous days. On Monday, former President D.T is expected to fly from Florida to New York. Then, on Tuesday, he will be formally arraigned on criminal charges in a historic indictment that remains under seal. Today, in West Palm Beach, Mr. T gave a thumbs up and waved to supporters from inside his SUV as he left his gulf club. He has not appeared before cameras to address his indictment but that is expected to change soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York remains on high alert ahead of former President T’s return to the city on Monday. He will be here at T tower ahead of his arraignment on Tuesday, then later Tuesday, fly back to Florida, where he plans to speak with reporters at Mar-a-Lago. Former T’s lawyer, J.T, vowing an aggressive legal strategy ahead of Tuesday’s arraignment. The charges remain under seal, but a source familiar with the indictment tell CBSN that former President T will likely be charged with falsifying business records in the first degree, a felony stemming from alleged hush money paid to adult film star S.D. M.C, a key witness in the investigation sat down with CBSN this weekend and said the case is about more than his testimony. New York remains on high alert ahead of Tuesday’s arraignment at a Manhattan courthouse. Most Republicans are offering T’s support, including Florida Governor R.D who slammed Manhattan District Attorney A.B.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 03.31.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.31.23/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Apr 2023 19:08:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.31.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;A massive storm system is unleashing violent tornadoes, and the threat is going to continue into the night. Nearly sixty million Americans on alert across twelve states now under tornado watches or warnings, with a number of twisters already touching down from Little Rock, Arkansas to Des Moines, Iowa. This enhanced storm risk is the largest ever issued by the National Weather Service. And it stretches from the deep south to the upper Midwest. Governor S.H has just declared a state of emergency in Arkansas. In Little Rock, a catastrophic tornado ripped apart homes and flipped cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A massive tornado touched down in North Little Rock, Arkansas late this afternoon, packing powerful winds and dumping heavy rain as it blew through the area moving fifty miles per hour. At least two dozen people have been hospitalized. The storm left behind homes in tatters, scattering debris for several blocks, downed powerlines and snapped tree limbs that fell on passing cars. As the storm cleared, some residents were in shock. Look at the woods back here. To the North in Iowa, another violent tornado struck near Iowa City with high winds and large quarter-size hail. While in Rolling Fork, Mississippi today, President B met with residents who are still recovering after an EF-4 tornado ripped through this community seven days ago. In addition to Arkansas state emergency, the National Guard has been activated to help the Little Rock. And there could still be plenty more devastation to come. There have already been almost a dozen tornado warnings here in Iowa, including here in Davenport, as this nearly nine hundred miles long system approaches east.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 03.30.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.30.23/</link><pubDate>Fri, 31 Mar 2023 21:58:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.30.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;First the time ever, a former president of the United States has been indicted will face criminal charges. A grand jury voting today to charge D.T. The precise charges are under seal and not yet known. A.B in the Manhattan District Attorney’s office case is related hush money payments former porn star S.D and the alleged cover up of those payments in financial records. All actions are from before he became president. But T also faces legal scrutiny in three cases from his time in office. Mr. T reacting just a short time ago, calling this a political persecution and a witch hunt. The former president has already declared as a candidate of 2024 race for the oval office. Also now to New York, because we’re learning there police have stepped up security and CBSN has learned that every NYPD officer including plain-clothed officers have ordered to be in full uniform for tomorrow shifts and they should be ready to deploy. There is concern about security. There is concern about protest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An explosive political and legal moment, a former president indicted while he runs once again for the presidency. And tonight T, moments ago, vowed to fight back calling this indictment political persecution at the highest level in history. The indictment is still under seal, but CBS has learned former President D.T will be instructed by the Manhattan District Attorney A.B to surrender and face arraignment. The charges are unknown for now but all center around payments made to adult film star, S.D. T, seeing from the indictment went on Truth Social to say “This is an attack on our country the likes of which has never been seen before”. Having a former president fingerprinted and then arraigned in open court presents some unprecedented challenges. The prosecution’s main witness is M.C who made the actual payment to D, a payment the former president had denied knowing about. Security had been increased around the Manhattan courthouse in recent days, and the DA had received death threats after T posted last week that he would be indicted. Now that the indictment has happened, police likely will ramp up their presence again.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 03.29.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.29.23/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Mar 2023 19:54:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.29.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, just days before Holy Weeks begins, Catholics are praying for Pope Francis. The Vatican says the eighty-six-year-old pope is in the hospital tonight after complaining of breathing problems. We’re now learning he will undergo treatments for several days at the hospital in Rome. It has been two years since Pope Francis last spent ten days in that same hospital at time for colon surgery. The pontiff’s audiences have been canceled for the rest of the week raising questions about whether he will be healthy enough for Eastern Sunday. At the White House President B told reporters he had just been told about the pope’s health problems and said he was concerned about his friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pope was reportedly taken into hospital in an ambulance it was quite a turn for what had appeared to be a completely routine day with the pope greeting faithful here in St. Peter’s square. This morning, Pope Francis was kissing babies, welcoming children and addressing crowds at his weekly audience. But the pontiff appeared pained as he helped into his popemobile and soon after he was brought to nearby Gemelli hospital for what a Vatican spokesman called quote “previously scheduled checks”. This evening, however, the Vatican revealed Pope Francis had complained of breathing difficulties in recent days and will be treated in the hospital for a respiratory infection which is not Covid-19. This month, Pope Francis celebrated his tenth year as head of the Catholic Church. But the eighty-six-year-old has long struggled with health issues. As a young man, one part of his lung was removed after a respiratory infection. In 2021, he underwent intestinal surgery at the same hospital where he is tonight. His predecessor Pope Benedict resigned in 2013, citing age and the demands of the job. When Benedict died on the eve of 2023, Pope Francis presided over his funeral. Despite the pontiff’s age and health issues, he keeps a packed schedule, traveling to South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 03.28.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.28.23/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Mar 2023 19:57:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.28.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Nashville and the rest of the nation are heartbroken after that deadly mass shooting at an elementary school. Tonight, we are learning new details about the victims. President B ordered flag to be flown at half staff for the rest of the month. Police say the school and church were targeted but the individual victims were not. And as investigators still search for a motive, we did learn today, that A.H legally stockpiled seven weapons in her family’s home beginning in October, 2020. The police chief also revealing the shooter was under a doctor’s care and the parents thought the shooter should not own weapons bringing widespread conversation about red-flag laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have new information about this attack tonight. We have learned that the shooter who was under medical care for emotional disorder, legally purchased seven firearms. They were hiding in her home, three of which were used in school. Also, Nashville police have now released body cam footage of those officers stopping the attack. These were the moment Nashville police responded to the call of act of shooting. Taking up the shooter with a burst of shots just minutes after entering the school and fourteen minutes from the first 911 call. Nashville police also release haunting surveillance video from inside the Christian School as the shooter gain access by firing unlocked glass doors, then walking hallways armed with two assault weapons and a handgun shooting an officer’s car from second floor window.

This time, at a private Christian grade school in Nashville. We’ve just learned more about the six victims, the three children, all nine years old. The three adults in their sixties. Tonight, police identified the shooter as a twenty-eight-year-old woman who previously attended the school and left behind a manifesto. Police confronted and quickly killed the shooter. These pictures of young kids holding hands to evacuate the school are reminiscent of the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School ten years ago. It’s all a chilling remainder about the leading cause of death for America’s children, guns. For decades, it was car accidents that were the main cause. Well, not anymore. Since 2020, firearms overtook crashes as the number one cause of death for kids. Police said the shooter was heavily armed and prepared to do even more harm. Well, today, President B renewed his call on Congress to pass a ban on assault weapons. Police today said, based on evidence they’ve gathered, this appears to be a targeted and well-planned attack. And the police chief is now saying they know the motive but are not yet ready to release it to the public. This latest school shooting has shattered yet another community in America. Tonight, the heartbreaking belongs to Nashville. This morning at the Covenant School, a Christian Elementary in Nashville for students preschool through six grades. Within minutes, Nashville police, SWAT teams and the FBI swarmed the school finding three students and three adults dead. On the second, authorities say, they confronted a woman, a twenty-eight-year-old former student armed with two assault style rifles and a handgun. Police today revealing the shooter identifies as a transgender. Terrified parents rushed to the school as their children were escorted out by police.

&lt;p&gt;Thirteen people were killed here in Rolling Fork, a small community of about two thousand and they cannot catch a breath. It is raining. There is more storm that are going to be in the forecast. That is slowing down the cleanup effort. In Rolling Fork, Mississippi, the damage is widespread and in every direction. The deadly EF4 tornado with wind speed up to 170 miles per hour turn homes and businesses into piles of rubble. Instead of Sunday service, it’s a salvage mission for a local pastor. The tornado tore the roof off the chapel and smashed the bell tower. The storm left a one hundred- and seventy-miles path of destruction. They started in Mississippi then traveled east where hail hammered Alabama. And in Georgia, a pair of tornadoes battered the western part of the state leveling dozens of homes and prompting the governor to issue a state of emergency. Back in Rolling Fork, the pastor says may have destroyed the church, but not the spirit of congregation. Emergency shelters are opened to get people out of this weather. And there are crews from multiple states here helping trying to get people back on their feet. But FEMA says this recovery will take a long time.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 03.25.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.25.23/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Mar 2023 20:00:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.25.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Communities in the south have been flooded by a series of tornadoes that tore through several states Friday leaving behind an almost apocalyptic path of destruction. More than two dozen people were killed in Mississippi, at least one in Alabama and the search for the missing is underway. President B pledged the government will do everything they can to help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tornado hit at night when the sun came up that’s when many residents realized their house tore down. This is some of the damages starting to see. The walls are gone, the roof is gone up on the home. Residents have been all days trying to pick up the pieces. The view above Silver City, Mississippi shows devastation all around. Homes flatten, cars destroyed and trees split apart. Houses were pummeled and roofs were ripped off. The National Weather Service says the tornado cut a path over one hundred miles long. And there is widespread structural damage in the city of Emery, including the water department, leaving residents under an emergency boil water notice. The county officials told us eighty-five percent of the homes here are damaged and it will take weeks to clean up. The Governor of Mississippi has issued a disaster declaration.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 03.24.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.24.23/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Mar 2023 22:22:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.24.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We want to begin with growing concerns about violence as D.T is using increasingly ominous and threatening rhetoric as his legal challenges mount. The top Democrat in the House warning the former president will get someone killed. This comes as an envelope with white powder and a note that read, “I’m going to kill you” was sent to Manhattan District Attorney A.B’s office today. CBSN has learned that security has been stepped up for B over the last few weeks. And just days ago, the New York City Courthouse where a grand jury is deciding T’s fate was temporarily shut down because of bomb threats. Meanwhile today, big developments probe by a special counsel, a federal judge ordering some of T’s closest personal, political and national security aids to testify before a different grand jury probing the January 6th attack on US Capitol that includes former chief of staff M.M.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A backlash today to the former president’s explosive comment about that ongoing investigation in New York days before possible decision on an indictment of T. The twice impeached former president’s rhetoric is reckless, reprehensible and irresponsible. House Democratic leader H.J sounding the alarm today after former President T warned that death and destruction is possible if he is indicted. T also reposted an ominous altered image where he is holding a baseball bat next to an image of Manhattan District attorney A.B, who has one of his hands raised. B, who now has increased security, received a death threat today at his New York office, a letter addressed to him with a note inside saying “A, I’m going to kill you”. It contained a small amount of white powder, but was determined to be non-hazardous. Meanwhile, T’s legal challenges in Washington are mounting. A federal judge ordered several of his former top aides to testify about his conduct before and during the January 6th Capitol attack, including former chief of staff M.M. This came as the special counsel probing T’s handling of classified documents heard testified today from T’s lawyer E.C, who prosecutors believed may have been misled by T about the retention of those documents.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 03.23.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.23.23/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Mar 2023 20:53:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.23.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, nearly fifty million Americans are in the path of dangerous weather as that storm system that spawned a bomb cyclone in California moves east. Plus in tonight’s Eye on America, we visit a small West Virginia town that’s still recovering from a “once in lifetime” flood. But first, the CEO of TikTok facing tough questions from lawmakers today during an often tense hearing about the safety and security of the popular social media app. Members of both parties grilled S.C about the company’s ties to China and harmful content pushed on children. The future of TikTok here in United States along with its one hundred and fifty million US users remains up in the air with the B administration threatening to ban the app. A new CBSN poll shows sixty one percent of Americans support that ban.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a grueling hearing that lasted more than five hours as TikTok’s CEO defended his platform in his appearance in Capitol Hill. From the beginning, S.Z.C, the CEO of the most downloaded app in the past two years, faced intense scrutiny. The TikTok executive tried to reassure lawmakers with a commitment to safety. And he insisted the video sharing platform is not an arm of the Chinese government despite being owned by a parent company ByteDance based in Beijing. C said the company is working to build a firewall, dubbed Project Texas, to store and protect user data in the US. Lawmakers also pressed C on harmful content aimed at younger users from buying drugs on the app to dangers of some TikTok challenges and videos promoting eating disorders and suicide behaviors. President B has banned the app on government devices along at least two dozen states. Congress is considering at least three bills that would further restrict TikTok or implement a nationwide ban. Tonight, the company accused the House Panel of political grandstanding and warned a ban could violate the first amendment and hurt the livelihoods of millions of users.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 03.22.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.22.23/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Mar 2023 19:27:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.22.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, California is picking up the pieces after being slammed by yet another major storm, including an apparent tornado. More on that in a moment. Plus, drug shortages are on the rise for some lifesaving medications including those used in cancer treatments. But first, the nation’s latest school shooting, this one at a Denver high school left two staff members including one who was taken into surgery with life-threatening injuries. Authorities say the suspect is a student who remains at large tonight and is considered armed and dangerous. School has canceled classes for the rest of the week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This suspect was known to school officials and was patted down on every day as he arrived here at school. It was during that search, police say, he pulled the gun and shot rang out. Tonight, the manhunt continues for seventeen-year-old A.L, the student who police say opened fire on two administrators. Authorities say the shooting happened just before 10:00 this morning inside Denver’s East High School during a mandatory search of the student because a past behavior. One victims is in critical condition undergoing surgery, another is stable and talking, police said. East High’s more than twenty five hundred students and staffs were immediately placed on lockdown. Soon after, shaken parents waited to pick up their children. There have been more than a hundred school shootings including on college campuses this academic year alone. Just last month, a student at the same school was shot and killed while sitting in a car outside the building, prompting a student walkout in March to the Colorado State Capitol demanding stricter safety rules.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 03.21.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.21.23/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Mar 2023 20:36:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.21.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, a powerful storm system moves ashore out West and it’s moving east. Plus, we are continuing our series, Facing Fertility with a look at tonight at the growing popularity of egg freezing. But first, the nation is awaiting a potential criminal indictment of former President D.T. The New York City police department placed steel barriers and cameras around the Criminal Courthouse in lower Manhattan ahead of a possible protests. Law enforcement sources tell CBSN that contingency plans are in place for potential violence. Similar precautions are taking place here in DC with barricades placed around the US Capitol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sources tell CBSN that the grand jury’s work here is nearly done, with prosecutors scratching out the framework for a possible indictment of former President T. But officials are increasingly on edge about security challenges and protests. The arrest of former President T predicted what happened today never did, but his call for protests has New York on high alert. Metal barricades have fortified the courthouse where he’d likely turn himself in. And all NYPD officers, numbering about thirty five thousand were ordered to be in full uniform and ready to mobilize. A bomb threat rattled courthouse proceeding this morning. But nothing was found. Security has also increased around the Capitol in Washington. Similar to the days after the January 6th attack. As T deals with a possible indictment, Florida Governor, R.D, moving closer to his own 2024 bid, said in a new interview today that character matters, a remark seen by some T advisors as not so veiled shot at T.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 03.20.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.20.23/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Mar 2023 21:12:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.20.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, we’ve got more of our 60 Minutes exclusive reporting as the US Navy Chief Naval Officer accuses China of trying to bully others. Plus, we talked to top gun officers and fighter pilots on how this conflict is different. Plus, our new series, Facing Fertility, on the emotional journey that millions of Americans that are suffer in silence. But first, we’ve got new reporting tonight about when and how D.T could be indicted and arrested. Tonight, the NYPD, the FBI, Joint Terrorism Task Force and the Secret Service are preparing for the worst. Barricades are going up today in downtown Manhattan outside the courthouse, where a grand jury is deciding whether or not to charge D.T with falsifying financial records linked to hush money payments to porn star, S.D. Here in the nation’s capital, CBSN has learned that Capitol police plan to take emergency measures ahead of possible arrest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Law enforcement officials from several agencies met today to discuss security and logistics as they brace for possible violence, should former President T be indicted. Steel barricades were delivered outside Manhattan Criminal Court this morning after former President T claimed he will be arrested on Tuesday and urge supporters to protest and take our nation back. Even though there is no evidence an arrest is coming tomorrow. Intelligence sources tell CBSN that they are seeing a significant increase in threats since T’s post, including violent rhetoric from domestic extremists. Mostly targeted toward law enforcement, judges and government officials in New York.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 03.19.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.19.23/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Mar 2023 20:11:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.19.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;US presidential history could be made, that’s if former President D.T is indicted by Manhattan Grand Jury following investigation into hush money paid for alleged sexual encounter with S.D. In social media post this weekend, Mr. T referred to the allegations as old and fully debunked. He also implored supporters to save America calling on them to protest, protest, protest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the former president predicted that he would be arrested on Tuesday. His team says that’s based off of media reports and that from Manhattan district attorney office. D.T was greeted with cheers at the NCAA wrestling championship in Tulsa, Oklahoma last night, his first public appearance since predicting his arrest and calling his supporters to protest. A Manhattan Grandy Jury is investigating the alleged hush money payment T made to adult film star S.D days before 2016 presidential election. T denies any wrongdoing, and Sunday, Republicans rushed to defense. T also faces criminal investigations in Georgia and Washington, accused of trying to avoid overturn the results of the 2020 election, and the Justice Department has been presenting evidence before a grand jury, investigating hundreds of classified documents found at T Florida estate.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 03.17.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.17.23/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Mar 2023 18:57:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.17.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, the FBI and Justice Department are investigating Tik Tok’s Chinese parent company for potentially spying on American citizens. Plus, it’s Friday, so we go on the road with an artist whose talent has given him a new lease on life. But first, extraordinary news today about Russia’s leader V.P. The International Criminal Court at the Hague issued an arrest warrant for the Russian president for war crimes, implicating him in the abduction of thousands of Ukrainian children during the war. Ukraine’s president hailed the move as a historic decision but the charges largely symbolic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight, the International Criminal Court is now backing Ukraine’s claim that Russia is abducting its children. Ukrainians here feels it’s the first step to justice. Russian propaganda claims the country is trying to save Ukraine’s children. And that the hearts of Russians are big and benevolent. But the International Criminal Court tonight was clear, Russia is kidnapping and reeducating children as Russians. Accused of war crimes are President V.P himself and M.L.B, the director of his alleged abductions. Moscow has denied the accusations and does not recognize the ICC. The news comes as diplomatic support arrives from China. Today, Beijing confirmed President X will travel to Russia to meet with P on Monday. Beijing has proposed a ceasefire, which the White House dismissed. And a new show of solidarity for Ukraine from Slovakia following Poland together pledged at least seventeen Soviet-designed fighter jets. While old or in need of repair, the hope is it could break Europe’s hesitation to send even more war planes. But, in a remote Ukrainian farming village Solonchaky, far from the halls of power, seventy-year-old N.K never imaging war would land in her backyard.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 03.16.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.16.23/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Mar 2023 20:12:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.16.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Well tonight, tens of millions of Americans are under weather alerts with severe storm sweeping across the southern plains, bringing heavy rain and possible tornadoes. Plus, America’s military services are following short of their recruitment goals. How the US Army hopes to change that. But first, the dramatic new video showing the physical confrontation between a US surveillance drone and two Russian fighter jets over the black sea. This video released by the Pentagon shows the war planes making several aggressive maneuvers near the drone and dumping fuel on it. This is the moment when one jet got too close and collided with the propeller. The Pentagon released pictures of the damage moments before the drone crashed into the Black Sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One White House official today said the Russians have been quote “flat out lying when they say two Russian jets never touched the drone” and now they released the images to prove it. The footage shows Russian jets making two passes from behind the drone, dousing it in a cloudy stream of fuel before one clips its propeller. Separate still images show what the drone’s propeller looked like before and after. The damage forcing American operators to let it glide down into the Black Sea. The visual evidence appears to refuse Russian claims that neither of its jets hit the drone. One US official tells CBSN that it was clear Russian pilot meant to drench the drone in gasoline, but cut it too close.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 03.15.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.15.23/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Mar 2023 20:04:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.15.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, an important consumer alert about the recall of millions of sleep apnea machines and the potential health risks to users. Plus, the inspiring story of one of the world’s best polar explorers, whose toughest journey was a battle with cancer. But first, the rising tension tonight after that confrontation between a US surveillance drone and Russian fighter jets over the black sea. The incident led to a rare phone call between the Secretary of Defense and his counterpart in Moscow. It’s the first time they’ve spoken in nearly five months. The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General M.M said recovering what’s left of the surveillance drone would be difficult. It’s likely thousands of feet deep underwater. But that isn’t stopping Russia from trying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President B was briefed again today on the downed drone while out here on the road. The Russian says relations between the two countries are at a low point, while White House officials warn all of this increases the risk of miscalculation. In the race to reach the debris of the downed drone, US officials say the Russians arrived at the scene first, about sixty miles southwest of Crimea Peninsula. But getting to it will be a challenge. Officials say the Russians will probably be able to collect some pieces of the unmanned MQ-9 Reaper like metal chunks. But the drone’s software was wiped to ensure nothing valuable was collected. The US has no presence in the Black Sea. But Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General M.M says allies could have it recovered. Former acting Director of the CIA M.M says the Russians might not glean much from a drome loaded with mostly cameras. But they would still want to recover it. The Russians claim the Americans’ increase flying operation is what led to the incident. But Defense Secretary L.A says it’s because of Russian aggression. And in a rare phone call with his Russian counterpart today, A made it clear “United States will continue to fly and to operate wherever international law allows”. With both sides trying to ratchet down tensions, General M stopped short of calling it an act of war. Now US officials are still reviewing photo and video that was transmitted by the drone before a crash to get a better sense of what happened and say they eventually plan to release what they can.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 03.14.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.14.23/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Mar 2023 19:31:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.14.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, the story-making international headlines, the first known physical confrontation between US and Russian military forces since the war in Ukraine began. A Russian fighter jet rammed a fifty-seven-million-dollar US drone, forcing it down. Plus, a new American college of cardiology study shows how much of good night sleep could have in your lifespan. But first, the intensified Nor’easter is slamming New England tonight about twenty three million Americans across twelve states are under a winter storm warning or advisory with some areas already getting more than two and a half feet of snow. Airports across the northeast in cities like New York and Boston are impacted with more than four thousand delayed flights and one thousand plus cancelations. Out west, nearly twenty seven thousand residents in California are under evacuation order during the flooding and landslide risks as the latest atmospheric river battered the state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It maybe the winter’s last wallow. The late season storm burying some areas is under two-feet of snow. Wind gust up to fifty-five miles an hour and heavy wet snow cutting power to hundreds of thousands.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 03.13.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.13.23/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Mar 2023 20:49:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.13.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, tens of millions of Americans across the northeast are in the path of a powerful Nor’easter which is expected to bring heavy snow, strong winds and dangerous travel conditions and widespread power outages. Also tonight, a no found in the bathroom of a United flight, warning about a bomb onboard. But first, new questions about how one of America’s bigger banks failed, and what’s being done to avoid contagion even after a second bank collapsed last night. CBSN has learned that Silicon Valley Bank was operating without a Chief Risk Officer for months while the Fed tonight promising a swift review of the oversight of SVB. Fear also spreading from Wall Street to Main Street. Look at this, trading was halted on at least twenty regional banks after shares fell by as much as eighty percent. President B speaking this morning before Wall Street opened tried to urge calm but he also took aim at the T administration for rolling back Dodd-Frank banking safety requirements. And after his address to the nation, the president flew to San Diego.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quick step taken by federal officials were designed to reassure Americans about the strength of the economy even in the wake of those two bank failures. The hope is that the collapse is contained and doesn’t set off a wider crisis. President B today calling for calm. The Federal government stepped in overnight, backstopping the failed bank in California and New York but worries persist that other smaller regional banks also could have similar issues. Several were battered in early trading today. Outside Silicon Valley Bank’s main branch today in Santa Clara, federal officials greeted bank customers lined up to get access to get their money.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 03.12.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.12.23/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Mar 2023 22:19:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.12.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The debate over collapse of Silicon Valley Bank intensified today hours before markets open worldwide and some companies brace for possible payroll challenges on Monday. B administration officials expressed confidence that the US financial system remain safe and sound, and that depositors nationwide should not worry about losing access to their money. But Democrats and Republicans remain on edge over the fallout and there is a divide over who is to blame and what should be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Late today, federal regulators said that all depositors of Silicon Valley Bank will get their money at no tax payer expense. They also said that a second bank signature was closed, but the deposits were secured. Federal regulators are scrambling following the sudden collapse of the Silicon Valley Bank. Treasury Secretary J.Y told CBSN today that the department is working fast to address the situation but is ruling out a bailout for SVB. The second largest bank collapse in US history is sparking alarm about reverberations amid rising interest rates. The bank failure is already affecting the businesses it financed including Roblox, Etsy and Roku. The FDIC seized control of the bank Friday which had more than hundred billion dollars assets. Today, lawmakers on both sides are pointing fingers but are hopeful for a swift solution and leaving the door open for possible acquisition of the failed bank.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 03.11.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.11.23/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Mar 2023 20:05:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.11.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, disaster in central California in the wake of tenth atmosphere river to wash over the state this winter. A lot of breaches near the farming communities prompting widespread evacuations and dozens of water rescues. Record snowfall in Sierra is also causing new avalanche and landslide fears as the state goes from one weather extreme to another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s called an atmosphere river, it’s a storm slammed California and now there is a danger of not only the snowpack but surging runoff that could devastate the state and more. Racing to dig out as already overwhelmed mountain communities struggled with rain and snow melt that could destroy more homes. Central California bore the brunt of this storm. Further north, this is just one of at least dozen rivers overflowed with officials monitoring thirty more statewide. In San Francisco, the winds and rains costed a massive tree to crush several cars.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 03.10.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.10.23/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Mar 2023 19:27:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.10.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, we take a look at an innovative program taking flight at one major US airline hoping to tackle the industry’s pilot shortage. Plus, it’s Friday, so we go on the road with an army widow, who’s keeping a long-held promise to her late husband. But first, an extremely rare and dangerous flash flooding emergency has just been issued for parts of California. President has approved a disaster declaration as a series of severe storms pound the state. Seventeen million residents are under flood alerts and thousands ordered to evacuated as overflowing rivers creeks send raging waters across roads and into homes. The storm has already been blamed for at least two deaths. And take a look at this, a small jet skidded off the runway until the mud this afternoon at an airport on the California coast. This is all due to a massive atmosphere river all across from Hawaii, bringing with it heavy snow, torrential rains and life-threatening floods and mudslides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a rare sight. Take a look at all this water flowing from the Folsom Dam behind me. Most of the state was in a drought just a couple of months ago. Now they’re releasing some thirty thousand cubic feet of water every second to prevent flooding we’ve seen across California today. This is what the monster storm is doing to California, rivers of water sweeping through this park, swallowing up a playground. Across the state, potentially life-threatening flooding. Mud, debris and powerful winds are downing trees, the damage especially severe near Santa Cruz where thousands were ordered to get out, roads washed away. The storm is also creating havoc in the mountains. Snow and ice made for treacherous driving along Interstate 5. There were warnings to stay off the roads. In some lower-elevation towns, torrential rain is coming down on piles of snow. We saw that threat firsthand directly across the fire house.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 03.09.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.09.23/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Mar 2023 19:27:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.09.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, a small look at smart glass, the new technology that could save you money on your energy bills and help the planet. Plus, honoring abolitionist H.T with a new monument to remember those who have previously been denied recognition. But first, yet another Norfolk Southern train has derailed, this time in Alabama with thirty-seven cars coming off the tracks. There are no reports of injuries or hazardous material and the NTSB is headed to the scene. The agency is also opened an investigation into the company’s safety practices after five serious incidents since December of 2021 including the toxic train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, all this taking place as Norfolk Southern CEO A.S was on the hot seat in Capitol Hill facing questions about the East Palestine derailment and its impact on the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the train went off the tracks just behind me, releasing toxic chemicals, this community has demanded Norfolk Southern clean up the mess that they say is making many of them sick. Today, many residents watch the senate hearing hoping lawmakers would hold the company accountable. This was the scene in Calhoun County, Alabama this morning after another north Norfolk southern train derailed. The train was the fourth operated by Norfolk Southern to derail in the last five weeks. It happened just hours before Senators from both parties grilled CEO A.S over the February 3rd toxic train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio. The railroad should be held responsible. A spokesperson for another Senate committee told CBSN that CEO A.S will appear before another Senate Panel on rail safety in about two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 03.08.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.08.23/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Mar 2023 19:27:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.08.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, what the FDA is saying about a nationwide shortage of Adderall, and how it’s impacting patients. Plus, ahead of March Madness meet the Rutgers player who traveled halfway around the world to live the American dream. But first, the federal government is stepping in monitoring the police department of a large American city. The Department of Justice report found that police in Louisville, Kentucky, regularly violated the constitutional rights of Black people. The investigation was prompted by the fatal shooting of B.T by police in 2020. It’s one of nearly a dozen DOJ investigations of police departments across the country. The Justice Department also announced it will review the use of force by the Memphis Police Department following the recent deadly beating of T.N.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This report is really stunning. It slams the Louisville Police Department for what it calls the culture of racial discrimination, claiming some of its officers leave some of their most brutal tactics for Blacks. The scathing DOJ report concluded that the Louisville Metro Police Department doesn’t always protect and serve, but instead often disrespected the people it is sworn to protect. Among the investigation’s findings, officers treat Blacks and Whites differently while driving Blacks in nearly four times as likely to be cited for improperly tinted windows and five times more for improper tags. The abuses extend to treatment of the disabled and even sex assault victims. The report also said that officers often use excessive force such as neck restraints, canines and tasers. The DOJ investigation was prompted by the death of B.T who was killed in her own home by police officers who were executing a no-knock search warrant on the wrong location in March of 2020. Currently, there are eleven open DOJ investigations of police departments or units nationwide. Among them, Minneapolis added in the wake of G.F’s death. Today, the Justice Department adding Memphis following T.N’ death two months ago.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 03.07.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.07.23/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Mar 2023 19:44:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.07.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, the downtowns in despair in cities across the country. Our report on how work from home is hurting small business. Plus, we’ve got a CBSN exclusive, a historic interview. We sat down with America’s highest-ranking female military officers to talk about facing discrimination with determination. But first, two of the four Americans who were kidnapped in Mexico were found dead today, while the other two are back in the US getting medical treatment. L.M, a thirty-three-year-old mother of five children, was making a second trip to the country for a cosmetic surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two of the victims are back on American soil, recovering at this hospital behind me while the US government is working to get back the other bodies of the other two victims. Now we talked to the wife of one of the survivors. And she told us family is still in shock. Two Americans who survived being caught in a shootout and kidnapped by cartel gunmen, were taken into hospital in Brownville, Texas today. Mexican authorities L.M and E.W at a stash house outside the city of Matamoros after gunmen moved them to multiple locations to avoid capture. It was the end of a road trip for cosmetic surgery, M, W with their close friends S.W and Z.B traveled last week from South Carolina to Matamoros so M could have cosmetic surgery. This video shows the moment when they were kidnapped at gunpoint after being caught in a shootout between rival cartel gangs, W and B were killed. Traveling abroad for medicine and medical procedures is common more than a million Americans traveled to Mexico for health tourism last year, spending about two hundred and fifty million dollars. Thirty years old W, a husband and father, was shot in the leg, but is expected to survive. CBSN has learned that M had been to Mexico before for a cosmetic surgery. Investigators are pointing the blame at the Gulf cartel for this incident, while Mexican authorities have announced that they’ve arrested a twenty-four-year-old in connection with this attack.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 03.06.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.06.23/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Mar 2023 20:47:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.06.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, nearly two dozen people are facing domestic terrorism charges after violence erupted at the planned site of a police training center currently under construction outside of Atlanta. Police say a group threw rocks, bricks and Molotov cocktails during the coordinated attack. Plus, tonight we’ll remember rock guitar legend G.R, the last surviving cofounder of Lynyrd Skynyrd. But first, the urgent search for four Americans citizens kidnapped at gunpoint in Mexico. The FBI is offering a fifty thousand dollar reward for the safe return of the Americans who were in Mexico to buy medicine but got caught in shootout. President B has been briefed and the State Department is working to secure their safe return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight, there are reports that the missing Americans may have been targeted by mistake. The FBI is now assisting with the investigation. This is the moment four Americans were kidnapped in Matamoros, Mexico just across the border from Brownsville, Texas. They were travelling in this white minivan with North Carolina plates when they came under fire. The video appeared to show a woman forced into the back of a pickup truck by men with guns, then two others, who appear hurt, loaded next to her. The Mexican president says they were going to buy medicine, less expensive in Mexico as hundreds of thousand of Americans do each year and they could have been mistakenly targeted. The White House today saying it’s closely following the situation. Matamoros is under level 4, Do Not Travel advisory for the US State Department. The same threat level issued in Iraq, Iran and Afghanistan. The city of roughly half a million people has been home to warning factions of the Gulf drug cartel for decades. The crimes are often unreported, journalists fearing for their safety.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 03.05.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.05.23/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Mar 2023 19:54:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.05.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The race for the White House is on. Former President D.T took a victory lap after winning more than sixty percent of a strow poll vote at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Maryland. Now, some of his potentially biggest challengers were no-shows at the event, as Republican Primary field is starting to take shape. For the Democrats, President B has yet to face any real competition from within his own party. But today on face the nation. West Virginia Senator and often-Democratic dissenter J.M left the door open for challengers. Mr. B who still has not officially announced his re-election campaign visited Selma, Alabama today, making his case rather for stronger voting rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President B visiting Selma, Alabama today to mark the fifty-eighth anniversary of Bloody Sunday. While there, he called for a legislation that would strengthen voting rights as we are wait an announcement on his potential reelection. In a historic visit to Selma on Sunday, President B walked across the Edmund Pettus Bridge, when demonstrators fighting for voting rights were attacked by state troopers. The president again pressed for voting rights legislation. Something he has not gotten across the finish line during the first half of his term. The visit comes as he looks to reassure a key voting bloc ahead of a potential 2024 campaign announcement. On Saturday, former President D.T headlined the annual CPAC gathering of conservatives. The former president saying he would stay in the race even if he were to be indicted in some of investigations he faces. At least three major GOP candidates have jumped into the race so far, with several, including the Florida Governor R.D yet to officially making an announcement.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 03.04.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.04.23/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Mar 2023 21:09:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.04.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Extreme weather sweep across the country. At least twelve people have died following severe storms in several states. Out west, Californians are reeling. Record snow falls, some powered by high winds, dropped more than twelve feet of snow over parts of the state in the last few days. The heavy snow has been buried neighborhoods, collapsed roofs, trapping some people in their homes for days. Further east, more than eight hundred thousand people are without power across five states, following severe storms, floodings, high winds and multiple tornadoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is no rain right now. But all over LA, what you’re seeing is trails washed out, trees down, and up in the mountain folks still snowed after this epic storm caught many off guard. Snapped trees, down powerlines and thousands trapped in their homes as crashing snow in the mountains in the southern California has many running out of food and power. The National Guard is going door to door, shoveling snow to clear paths. But even with the other first responders helping, it could take up to a week to reach everyone. In northern California, there is no time to dig out as another storm blankets the Sierra Nevada. New England residents joined the millions nationwide bracing for another winter storm. The strong system destroyed several storms across the south after bringing hail, tornadoes and powerful winds. Back in southern California, a rain-saturated cliff gave way Friday, and several homes are in danger of tumbling down. And for those in the mountains, the fear and frustration still remain.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 03.03.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.03.23/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Mar 2023 20:44:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.03.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, it’s Friday, so we go on the road with the story about love taking flight. Plus, we continue our series of retirement ready with the growing trend of multiple generational housing. We’ll show you why millions of seniors are moving back in with their children. But first, that breaking news. The White House doctor just announced that President B had skin cancer removed during his physical last month. Roughly three and a half million Americans face that diagnosis each year, including his wife. First Lady J.B had basal cell carcinoma lesions removed earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During that exam, small skin lesion on President B’s chest was removed for a biopsy, and it turned out to be cancerous. In a new memo released today, the president’s doctor said it was a basal cell carcinoma, a common form of skin cancer that does not spread like other more serious types. He said all cancer tissue was successfully removed and no further treatment is required. There was, of course, increase attention on eighty-year-old President B’s health as he is expected launch a reelection campaign in the coming months. His doctor has deemed him healthy, vigorous, and fit.&lt;/p&gt;

In our eye on America, school teachers are now enlisted to help save lives amid the rising number of teen fentanyl poisonings. Plus, our retirement series continues with a lesson on never giving up on your lifelong dream from a seventy-nine-year-old college senior. But first, there is breaking news, A.M is found guilty in murdering his wife and twenty-two-year-old son. The jury in the case deliberated for just about three hours. Now M faces thirty years to life in prison. Prosecutors say the disgraced South Carolina attorney killed his wife and youngest son to distract from his mounting financial crimes and drug addiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The jury deliberated for only three hours as A.M was handcuffed in courtroom. He looked back at his surviving son B who was there. He would not make eye contact with his father. Silently standing, A.M stared straight ahead as the jury read its verdict finding him guilty of murdering his wife and son as well as two charges of possession of a weapon during the commission of a violent crime. After nearly six weeks of testimony that captivated the world, it took the jury just three hours to convict M despite no witnesses and investigators never finding a murder weapon or bloody clothes. Earlier in the day, defense attorney J.G argued the police investigation was sloppy.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 03.01.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.01.23/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Mar 2023 18:53:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.01.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, our continuing series on Retirement focuses on tens of millions of Americans that don’t have a retirement plans with their employers. So with some advices, what you can do to up your savings as you approach the golden years. But first, we want to get straight to that breaking news. A Pennsylvania man under arrest tonight after he allegedly tried to check a bag with what the TSA says was indeed, a live explosive device. That flight was bound for Florida. Also in the bag, according to investigators a can of highly flammable butane, a lighter, a pipe with white powder residue and a wireless drill cordless battery. And now part of the airport was evacuated. The forty-year-old man was in charge with attempting to place an explosive or incendiary device on an aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investigators say this is M.M, caught on Lehigh Valley International Airport surveillance cameras Monday pulling two black pieces of luggage and allegedly booked a flight on Allegiant flight 201 bound for Orlando. According to court documents, M never got on that flight. But he did check one of the bags. The TSA screening found a circular compound, approximately three inches in diameter hidden in lining of the baggage with two fuses attached, plus a mixture of flash powder used in commercial grade fireworks. Authorities paged M over the airport’s public address system. But he left the airport and went home. A bag tag with his name on it helped investigators tracking him down and arrest him.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 02.28.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.28.23/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Mar 2023 19:53:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.28.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, we continue our series on retirement with some important tips on how to get emotionally prepared for your golden years. Plus, how a jazz legend from New Orleans is inspiring the next generation to make sure the music never stops. But first, two major winter storm systems are blasting the US from coast to coast on this final day in February. In the northeast, as much as seven to eight inches of snow was on the ground by morning in western Massachusetts while Fairfield County, Connecticut got more than a foot. This as the second powerful storm moves into the western US bringing blizzard warnings and dangerous travel conditions to California Sierra Nevada. This latest system will move across the southern US with days ahead. And it is expected to turn into a severe weather later in the week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This city was slapped with more than six inches of snow which meant that dozens of snowplows spent the day clearing roads and piling up the white stuff into mounds like you see behind me. It was manageable here. Still, this late season, chill was felt all over. For many in New England, the overnight snow storm was a welcome sign in what’s been a mild winter. For M.B, who owns a snow removal company, it simply meant relief after a long season of struggle. New York City escaped the brunt of winter blast. Fewer than two inches of snow fell in Manhattan, turning the morning commute into a slushy mess. In Michigan, the cleanup continues from last week’s ice storm. Thousands of homes have been without power for up to six days. In northern California, major highways are shut down, a blizzard warning in effect through the night.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 02.27.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.27.23/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Feb 2023 21:18:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.27.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, we begin our new series Retirement ready with a look at millions of Americans who are worried about not having enough money to retire, especially with the stock market and dwindling 401k plans. Plus, speaking of retirement, we sat down with tennis great S.W and what she thinks about that word after leaving tennis five months ago. But first, the severe weather causing havoc coast to coast. Tonight, large parts of the northeast are under a winter storm warning from New Jersey to Maine. A massive system is expected to bring more than a half foot of snow to some areas through tomorrow. It’s part of the same system that brought a rare blizzard warning to southern California last week. Also, in the Midwest, thunderstorm, damaging winds and several tornadoes downed trees and powerlines in Illinois and Ohio. And last night in Oklahoma and Kansas, at least nine twisters touched down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those storms moved in fast, and you can see some of the damage here that these tornadoes caused. Cars flipped on top of each other. At the same time, the roofs were ripped off these homes. But what the storm did not do was slow down the cleanup effort as we saw neighbors helping neighbors. In northern Oklahoma, residents shoveled debris after a series of tornadoes raked across the Sooner State. Drone videos shows the path of destruction in this neighborhood, roofs ripped off homes. The overnight storms powerful winds smashed windows and turned cars into projectiles. At least seven tornadoes touched down in Oklahoma Sunday, the most for any day in February and two more in Kansas. The system also brought twisters to Illinois and Ohio this afternoon. In the west, California is cleaning up after historic winter weather trigger landslides over the weekend. Parts of Los Angeles County saw more than ten inches of rain. To the north, drivers are being urged to stay off the roads with blizzard warnings in Sierra with another six feet of snow expected to fall.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 02.26.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.26.23/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Feb 2023 20:19:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.26.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, more than ten million people from Texas to Missouri are threatened by severe and dangerous weather. Oklahoma could see the worse of it with thunderstorms forecast to bring destructive winds as powerful as category two hurricane. Tornadoes are possible. The same storm system impacted southern California this weekend. Look at those pictures, a mix of misery and it’s not over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been tough. California is getting a small break, but is bracing for more snow and rain to come later on this week. This tree behind me fell on Friday. And it’s still here showing just how much need to clean up there still is. Road shut down due to rockslides, apartment rent tag deemed unsafe to live in due to toppled trees, and major freeways closed because of heavy snow went dangerous ice. California gets a temporary break to assess damage before another storm slams the state. The rains have been relentless and prompted several swift water rescues including this one in Pasadena. About thirty miles north in Santa Clarita, RV owners are keeping a close eye on their homes after a cliff collapsed sending three into the river below. Heavy snow in some areas up to six feet stranded many including on California’s Grapevine, the major artery connecting southern and northern part of the Golden State, smaller highways were also impassable. The freezing storm left many shivering and surprised to see snow in such normally sunny spot of San Diego and Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 02.25.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.25.23/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Feb 2023 20:19:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.25.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, a powerful winter storm that piled up snow, prompted blizzard warnings, water rescues, and freeway closures is on its way out of southern California. More than thirty million Americans today woke up on weather alerts. In Los Angeles, a city famed for its palm trees, was chilled after a dusting of snow. This was the storm seen from space today as it flowed over California coast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California took a direct hit from the storm. LA’s beaches are still closed, so is Yosemite National Park. And California is only beginning to assess the damage. Mudslide fears tonight in southern California after record-breaking rain and snow pummeled the state. Several motor homes parked above the river fell in when the ground gave way. Swift water rescue crews saved people trapped in flooded cars while some drivers had to wait for help. Others near Burbank Airport just had to abandon their vehicles. Both rain and snow closed parts of the freeway, the major artery connecting northern and southern California, and hundreds of thousands were without power. The unprecedented snow which is weakening as it moves east, triggering rare blizzard warnings left snow on California beaches and caught many Californians off guard. Some good news, this historic winter storms have led to a booming snow pack which is a major source of water for drought-stricken California. It’s already at 120% of the average season. The storm is easing Californian drought. But one of the state’s largest reservoirs are still only half full. That next month will be critical in determining how much water we have.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 02.24.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.24.23/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Feb 2023 20:19:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.24.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;But first, part of the reason we came to report from the USS Nimitz is to just expose cruel challenges facing the Pentagon as Russia continues its war of aggression against Ukraine. Well today, China is calling for peace talk and the meeting between Chinese President X and Ukraine’s Z.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Millions of people across have marked one year at war today, with the mixture of remembering and defiance. A lengthy news conference here in Kiev tonight, President V.Z vowed that Ukraine will be victorious if its allies, like the US remain united like a fist. Terrified explosion and air raid sirens have filled the skies around Kiev for exact one year ago today. In a solemn memorial honoring lives lost and saluting those still fighting for the survival of the country. That sense of reflected around the world. As Ukraine was entered its second year, Russian brutal invasion, the number of dead and wounded on both sides of the conflict is in a hundred of thousands, a statistic almost impossible to comprehend. We have to report tonight that another American has been killed in an action, twenty-eight-year-old A.P, an US army veteran from Wisconsin. He was fight with the international legion. We happened to meet him just a week ago when he was on some tasks in Kharkiv, he said he was headed back to the fight in Dumbass region.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 02.23.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.23.23/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Feb 2023 20:19:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.23.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, we’re broadcasting live abroad the USS Nimitz. And while we can’t give you our exact location, we can tell you we are here in the western Pacific Ocean. We landed here just moments ago after boarding a C-2 Greyhound in Guam and landing on the deck of this massive aircraft carrier that stretches nearly eleven hundred foot long. That’re more than three football fields. And about this exact location, it’s called Vulture’s Row. It is a viewing platform high above the flight deck where the crew and others can observe the flight operations below. Today, the world is marking one year in the war in Ukraine when Russia unleashed the largest ground invasion in Europe since World War II. We’ve got reports tonight from Ukraine and from the Pentagon. Tonight, the US is confirming that they’re going to be sending additional troops Taiwan. That’s big news. It is historic because the troops will deploy to the crucial island to help build out a training program amid increasing tensions with China. It’s here in the western Pacific where America’s Naval power is on full display. The USS Nimitz with more than sixty planes and five thousand sailors. Guam is where we work off from this morning. It is considered the tip of the spear. One part of the Marianas, a strategic location used during World War II to launch the bombs that forced Japan to surrender. Today, Guam houses three military bases for Air Force, Navy, and now a new home to five thousand crews. The first new US military base in seventy years. Part of the new buildup in the region. Defense Secretary L.A announcing earlier this month the US will expand its military presence in the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 02.22.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.22.23/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Feb 2023 20:19:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.22.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, our in-depth look at what earthquake-prone California is doing to prevent large scale destruction when the big one hits. Plus, we’ll meet a teen pageant queen who’s also a state champion wrestler. But we begin with a coast-to-coast outbreak of severe weather threatening more than seventy-six million people across twenty-six states. The Dakotas, Minnesota, and Wisconsin are bearing the brunt of the blizzard threat, with some areas bracing for nearly two feet of snow, powerful gusts and wind chills as low as minus thirty degrees. Farther east, an ice storm is making for treacherous traveling conditions. The storm also disrupted more than five thousand flights just today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the plows around here have been busy. There’s about eight hundred that have been going around the city surrounding areas pretty much non stop trying to keep the roads passable. But the mayor is asking everyone to stay off the streets starting tonight. That’s because what you can see coming in, it’s only the beginning. A bone crushing winter storm is putting Minnesota on ice. And the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and Saint Paul are in its crosshairs. By late afternoon, a second round of snow kicked into higher gear, falling as much as two inches an hour. Wind chills made it feel like three degrees today. Gusts up to forty-five miles per hour produced white out condition and nearly impossible driving conditions in some parts in state. The metro area could be buried under nearly twenty inches by the time the storm moves out tomorrow. Some residents went running, other sprinted to the grocery store stock up supplies.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 02.21.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.21.23/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Feb 2023 20:19:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.21.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, CBSN goes in-depth in part two of our series on Americans being exposed to the chemicals in our foods and what’s has been done about it. Plus, how President J.C’s hometown, Plains, Georgia celebrates his life every day of the year. But first, President B in a remarkable speech promising the United States’ unwavering support for Ukraine. In a message to the world from the Royal Castle gardens in Warsaw, Poland. The president marked one year since Russia’s invasion with the clear message to V.P saying NATO has never been more united, democracies around the world are stronger than ever and vowing that Russia will never win in Ukraine. In his State of the Nation address, P falsely tried to blame the west for the war. It was a hundred minutes speech. And he also suspended Moscow’s participation in the last remaining nuclear arms treaty with the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;White House officials insist the president’s speech wasn’t designed to be a response to V.P, because it had been in the works for several weeks. But the dueling appearances led to a global tit for tat. The Russian leader accused western nations of wanting to strike his country. The American president denied that and defended Ukraine’s right to exist. President B in Warsaw, President P in Moscow with dueling messages on the eve of first year of war in Ukraine. Mr. B recalled his high stakes trip to its capital. Thousands of Polish citizens, Ukrainian refugees and American diplomats and aid workers gathered to see the president, the centerpiece of a stage featuring smoke machines and resembling a rock concert. Hours earlier, P’s national address was delivered to a room of loyalists. He claimed Russia isn’t fighting Ukrainian people, but that they’ve become hostage to western masters. And said the west is responsible for fueling the Ukrainian conflict. P also announced he’s suspending participation in the last remaining nuclear arms reduction treaty with the US.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 02.20.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.20.23/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Feb 2023 20:19:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.20.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Well, tonight, CBSN goes in depth with a look at how Americans exposed to chemicals through food. Plus, the story of two eighty-one-year-old best friends were in the once life time trip around the world. But first, the big story today at top secret and historic trip for President B to Ukraine. Security was tight and it’s the first time in modern history that an American president travel to a war zone while there was not a US military presents on the ground. President’s motorcade slipped out of the White House 3:30 AM on Sunday morning to begin a nearly forty-hour journey in and out of Ukraine. There were no flashy motorcades or Air Force one for this journey. Instead, he took an Air Force C-32 to get to the Poland and then, at 10:00 PM at night, boarded an approximately eight-car train for a ten-hour journey into Kiev, arriving in the Ukraine’s capital just as the sun was rising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B’s journey had a huge impact, not just for the Ukrainian leaders in that room, but for the Ukrainian people seeing a US president actually visiting in person. It’s becoming a difficult fight. They’re taking losses, they’re tired. And this is a major boost for morale here. Under a cloak of secrecy and amid tight security, President J.B rolled into Kiev’s Central Station early this morning, a discreet start to a dramatic visit, a symbol of solidarity with President V.Z meant to boost morale in Ukraine and a defiant message to Russia. The two men met for nearly two hours in part discussing in detail the situation on the ground here. President B marked one year this week since the invasion began, and saying many thought Kiev would fall within days. President Z expressed his gratitude to the US and said we hope that this year, 2023, will become a year of victory. As they wrapped up President B’s five hour visit and almost on cue, air raid sirens blared as the two men walked together triggered by a Russian fighter jet taken off in Belarus, which borders Ukraine just sixty miles in north. Even though the White House had informed Moscow of the president’s visit.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 02.19.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.19.23/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Feb 2023 17:19:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.19.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Today, in outpouring of tributes for former President J.C after it was announced that he would be receiving hospice care at home. At age ninety-eight years old, Mr. C is the nation’s oldest living president. His decision follows a series of hospital says in many years of health. Today, President B and First Lady J.B said they admire Mr. C for his strength and humility adding that they hope he continue his journey with grace and dignity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since President C’s decision was made public, people here in this town, so intertwined with his life have been reflecting on his legacy and praying. This morning, churchgoers quietly congregated at Maranatha Baptist in Plains where former President J.C has long taught Sunday school. But this Sunday, on the eve of President’s Day, it was C’s niece K.F who taught, and spoke movingly of her uncle. On Saturday, J.C, the president’s grandson wrote on Twitter that his grandfather and grandmother, former First Lady R.C are at peace and as always, their home is full of love. And the Secret Service spokesman said “Rest easy, Mr. President. We will be forever by your side.”&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 02.18.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.18.23/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Feb 2023 17:19:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.18.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;There is breaking news tonight. Former President J.C has decided against any further medical treatment and entered home hospice care. Mr. C is now ninety-eight years old. His decision follows a series of hospital statements. This weekend, several family members have gathered at the C’s home in Georgia. The statement released by the C center announced Mr. C decided to spend his remaining time at home with his family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The former president is the longest living US president in American history. He only served one term, but his time outside the building behind me that’s really defined him later decades, volunteering for habitat humanity and speaking out for social justice issues. He was diagnosed brain cancer in 2015, which he beat then he had a serious health problem in 2019, that he stopped from what he is doing his favorite things, to teach his Sunday school at church. Of course, here in Washington, President B also went to mass, and Vice President K.H is overseas attending an annual conference with diplomats and security officials. That conference was supposed to be mainly focused on Russia and Ukraine, but its high profile meeting on the sideline between the US and China that’s threatening to pofocus.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 02.17.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.17.23/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Feb 2023 13:19:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.17.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;First, a counterterrorism raid in east Syria got four US service members injured. Three of the four had wounded serious enough, they need to be evacuated to a military hospital in Germany. The US military operation took out senior ISIS leader H.O who supplied suicide invests to other operatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A leader of the ISIS terrorist network in Syria is dead, but at the price of four wounded Americans. US special operation forces went in by helicopter and surrounded the non-descripted house in northeast of Syria. But as they closed in on their target, an explosion, either a suicide vest or hand grenade went off. It is a constant threat. In 2019, when commandos raided the Syrian compound of the ISIS leader A.B, he blew up himself and three children to avoid capture. Last year, A.Q, another leader of the ISIS, set off a booby trap that leveled the third floor of his house, killing himself, his wife and two children. This time, the target was H.AH, in Al-Khajjah. And this time, he apparently waited for the Americans to get close enough. There are about nine hundred American troops in the Syria, working with local Syrian force to keep the ISIS terrorist network from staging a comeback. It’s a deadly game. But no American troops were killed or wounded in all of last year.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 02.16.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.16.23/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Feb 2023 20:29:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.16.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, four six million people are dealing with a dual threat of winter storms and possible tornadoes. That system is already dropping more than eight inches of snow in parts of Iowa, making for dangerous driving conditions. It is now moving east and could dump up to a foot of snow in Maine. Meanwhile, millions in the south are at risk for tornadoes, hail, and high winds. Also, in our eye on America tonight, black Americans are twice likely to die from heart disease than white Americans. But first, President B speaking in-depth for the first time about the Chinese spy balloon and those other objects discovered over the last two weeks. US officials now believe the three items shot down in North American airspace were likely tied to private companies or research groups. But the president did say he plans to speak with Chinese President X about the situation.
These were the president’s most extensive comments yet about all four shoot downs. He said that the most of debris from the Chinese balloon has now been recovered from the Atlantic ocean. And he acknowledged that the three other objects which still have not been recovered likely won’t involved in spying at all. President B confirmed today that the three objects he ordered to shot down last weekend probably posed no threat to people on the ground. Newly enhanced military radar picked up the three objects on three consecutive days as it floated at the same height commercial airliners use. The objects were shot down by US fighter jets using missiles worth half a million dollars each. At least one hobby group has already come forward to say their homemade balloon went missing last Saturday, the same object over Canada’s Yukon territory. Chinese officials still deny, that the massive balloon that started this whole sage was used for spying. Today they accused the US of smearing them and escalating tension. US officials tell CBSN that there is a growing belief that the Chinese didn’t initially intend to fly the balloon across America. The Pentagon tracked the balloon as it lifted off from China’s Hainan Island two weeks ago, and began heading east toward Guam and Hawaii. The theory is that it was then blown off course by prevailing winds, first toward Alaska, and then down over the continental United States.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 02.15.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.15.23/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Feb 2023 21:29:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.15.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Ahead, the news we are just getting in about an American icon. Actress and international sex symbol R.W have died at the age of eighty-two. The star of the 1960s and 1970s appeared in nearly one hundred films and TV shows including One Millions Years BC. Also tonight, the Holocaust-era musical instruments that were saved after World War II now inspiring a new generation around the world. But first, the chaos in the courtroom at the sentence hearing of the white supremacist who killed ten black people at a Buffalo supermarket in May of last year. As families of the victims faced the shooter for the first time, a man who lost his aunt had to be restrained by police. The emotional moments followed an apology from the gunman, he blamed his racist hate on what he’s read online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Family members of the victims have been carrying their grief with them for the past nine months. Today they exhaled, releasing their anger, releasing their heartbreak during a more than two hour court hearing. Speaking directly to the man who murdered their loved ones, one after the other, they stepped forward. They denounced the mass shooting in which the gunman killed ten people, ranging in age from thirty-two to eighty-six, in the aisles of the Tops supermarket. Investigators say the gunman, who didn’t live in Buffalo, is an avowed white supremacist. He livestreamed the massacre after planning it for weeks. They say he specifically targeted the store in black people. The convicted killer sentenced to life without parole. He will be in federal court tomorrow, facing twenty-seven felonies, including hate crimes and the possibility that he could face the death penalty.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 02.14.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.14.23/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Feb 2023 21:23:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.14.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Ahead, the new report that inflation is cooling but still too high. Tonight, we’ll look at what it means for you the rising cost of car insurance nationwide. In tonight’s Money Watch we look at what you can save on your bill. Also, on this Valentine’s Day, we got the ultimate love story, two patients those hearts literally brought them together. But first, we’re learning about the young lives cut short in that deadly mass shooting at Michigan State University. They all went to high school in the Detroit suburbs. Sophomore B.F was president of his fraternity, Junior A.F was studying Biology and Junior A.A wanted to become the first doctor in her family. Sadly, this is the sixty seventh mass shooting in America in 2023. That means there have been more mass shootings than days so far this year. President B today renewing his call to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the academic building where the police says first shooting was reported. Students here tell us when they heard a gunman was on campus, they fled or barricaded themselves in their dorms. One told me he called his family while in hiding. He thought it could be the last time he spoke to them. Police say the first dispatch calls came in around 8:18 PM, after a gunman opened fire inside Berkey Hall Monday. Inside, officers found two MSU students dead and several wounded. They said the gunman then went to the nearby student union, where he killed another student. Authorities have identified the shooter as forty-three-year-old A.M. They say he died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound and that he had no known affiliation with the school. The shooting comes nearly five years to the day since seventeen students and staff were killed in Parkland, Florida. The number of children in K-through-12 experiencing school shooting since 1999 has surged from 187,000 in 2018 to more than 338,000 now. Some students here have survived other school shootings, including one in Oxford, Michigan just fifteen months ago and the one at Sandy Hook Elementary back in 2012. Classes here are canceled until Monday.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 02.13.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.13.23/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Feb 2023 20:17:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.13.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, we are beginning our heart health theory with new information about how women experience symptoms differently, even respond differently to heart attacks. Also, a history making Super Bowl if you watched. Well, as R performed, the other historic moment that you may have missed, we’ll tell you about it. But first, we are just getting new pictures of the Chinese spy balloon shot down off the coast of South Carolina. CBSN has learned the Navy has recovered a significant portion of the antenna from the bottom of the ocean. But tonight, there are new questions after the US military shot down those three objects over the last three days, Friday, Saturday and Sunday over Alaska, Canada and one of the Great Lakes. Well, today the Defense Secretary said the Pentagon has not recovered any of the debris from those objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;US officials couldn’t say today whether these objects belong to China or to some other government or even to a company or individual. They say President B made the decision to have them all shot down because they could not rule out the possibility that they were being used for spying. A mystery in the skies causing confusion on the ground. The latest object appeared about a week after the Chinese spy balloon was taken out off the South Carolina coast. On Friday, the object roughly the size of a small car was shot down over sea ice in remote northern Alaska. On Saturday, it was a cylindrical object hovering over Canada’s Yukon territory. And on Sunday, an octagonal object over Michigan’s Lake Huron. That won’t be easy until debris from this weekend’s objects can be recovered. Unlike the Chinese spy balloon, US officials say these objects did not appear to be sending in any communications signals process any maneuvering or propulsion capabilities. But at twenty thousand to forty thousand feet, they did pose potential risks to civil aviation according to Defense Secretary L.A. The Chinese government claim today that the US had flown more than ten high-altitude balloons into their airspace since last year. US officials quickly denied it. Despite heavy seas, the Navy has now recovered a thirty to forty foot chunk of the Chinese balloon’s antenna array from the bottom of the Atlantic ocean. As for the other mystery objects, US officials have ruled out one possibility. After the spy balloon incident about a week ago, the nation’s radar system was adjusted to make it more sensitive. And officials say that’s big part of the reason that they’re now detecting more objects but what lawmakers want to know is what the criteria is that President B is going to use for deciding when to shoot objects down now that the US is detecting so many more of them.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 02.12.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.12.23/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Feb 2023 20:56:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.12.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;It has happened again. Today, another aerial object was shot down by US warplanes, amid bipartisan about an absence of details regarding these incidents the latest shoot down happened over Lake Huron, following those over Canada’s Yukon territory and off the coast of Alaska and the Carolinas. In a tweet, Representative E.S of Michigan said the object was downed by pilots from the US Air Force and National Guard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four take downs in eight days. It’s the latest in a series of responses to those unidentified high-altitude objects floating over North America. Officials on both sides are demanding more details as other officials say that the object was smaller and didn’t closely resemble the Chinese spy balloon that was shot down earlier this month. Canadian Prime Minister J.T double down on his decision to take out unidentified object over the Yukon on Saturday. US and Canadian forces are now in recovery mode, piecing together several objects that American fighter jets shot down. The US downed an aerial object the size of a small car on Friday over Alaska. It landed on sea ice and crews are still working to get answers on who owned it and what it was. Lawmakers, who were critical over President B’s timing on shooting down the Chinese spy balloon over earlier this month, say while they’re demanding details on who is behind the latest objects, they’re pleased with the response. Officials are on alert, temporarily shutting down the airspace over Montana on Saturday after concerns of a radar anomaly near the Canadian border. Today, they said it was an unmanned object which was shot down over Lake Huron. Now, senior administration officials here at the White House say they have no indication that the latest unmanned object had surveillance capability but they are not ruling that out. They also say that the object didn’t pose any military threats to the ground.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 02.11.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.11.23/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Feb 2023 22:03:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.11.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;There is breaking news tonight. An American fighter jet has shut down another unidentified object. This time, over Canada, just one day after warplane took similar action over Alaska and one week after a Chinese spy balloon was shut down off the Carolina coast. Canadian Prime Minister J.T says the shoot down happened over the Yukon territory. In a tweet tonight, T said he ordered NORAD to take down the object that had violated Canadian airspace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another tweet just a little while ago, T says he also spoke with President B and he thanked NORAD for keeping watch. He says Canadian forces are going to recover and analyze the wreckage of the object. But American forces still haven’t recovered the wreckage of the object they shut down on Friday. Nor has the Department of Defense provided any more details as to what exactly it was. The F-22 fighter jet shot down the unidentified floating object about the size of a small car off the frozen coast of Alaska Friday on the order of the president. The US military is scouring the frozen Arctic for the wreckage while also searching off the Carolina coast for the payload of a huge Chinese surveillance balloon shot down last week. In an exclusive interview, Defense Secretary L.A told CBSN all bases where US nuclear forces are located were ordered to cover up as the Chinese airship passed over the United States. Initially spotted above Montana, the balloon did not loiter over any other locations, instead floating across the US as fast as the wind could carry. But when A tried to call his Chinese counterpart after the shootdown, he says they essentially left him on read. Now, Department of Defense sources tell CBSN one of the reasons they’ve been unable so far to get to that object that was shut down in Alaska is because they’re being hampered by conditions. The recovery degree is -45°.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 02.10.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.10.23/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Feb 2023 19:28:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.10.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, the losses in Turkey and Syria climb to more than twenty three thousand. There are some glimmers of hope, a ten day old child and his mother pulled alive from the rubble. In this family, a husband, wife and their four children were rescued after one hundred and one hours trapped under debris. A small air pocket keeping them alive. Another story we are tracking, an FBI search in M.P’s home is now over. After five hours, agents tonight leaving with additional documents and we’ve got new information on that in just moment. But first, the new question tonight after the White House revealed just this afternoon that an F-22 fighter jet shut down another object flying over Alaska. The debris landed on a frozen body of water. So, the Pentagon is working to recover the object. Officials are trying to determine what the object was doing and if China or any other country had anything to do with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight, Pentagon officials say they don’t know who owned or operated the object what it was capable of, or why it was in the air. But they are certain it would have been too risky to wait for all those answers before taking it out. On the orders of President B, the F-22 fighter jet shut down the unidentified object at 1:45 this afternoon. The White House says the US first detected the unmanned object last night, flying at forty thousand feet above the northern coast of Alaska and floating northeast while within the range of commercial planes. Pentagon officials said the latest object was shut down so quickly because it was over frozen water making it easier to recover and because its size would create less of a debris field. Several military aircrafts are now involved in the recovery effort off the coast of Alaska. The object breached the US airspace less than a week after the military shut down of Chinese spy balloon which also entered over Alaska before making its way over several states in seven days, prompting bipartisan backlash over how long it took. Today, the US announced it added Chinese firms that are connected to Beijing’s surveillance balloon program to an export blacklist so they can’t access US technology or goods. The White House says they have not reached out to China about this new object shut down.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 02.09.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.09.23/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Feb 2023 21:39:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.09.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;There is breaking news that we are just getting in. CBSN has learned the former Vice President M.P subpoenaed by the special counsel investigating the former President D.T. We’ve got new details on that in just a moment. The other big story that is making international headlines, North Korea showcasing the largest number of nuclear weapons in a parade, and what appearance of K.JU’s daughter means about the future of the K dynasty. But first, desperation is setting in as the death toll continues to surge in Turkey and Syria. The race to find survivors has reached a critical point as temperatures fall and the vital seventy two hour period has passed. Satellite images of the area shows the scope of the devastation with before and after photo revealing the utter destruction of the landscape. It’s hard to imagine, but the images from Syria, are even worse. Nearly all the buildings in this before and after image being reduced to rubble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve spent more than sixteen hours today traveling across the disaster zone meeting people like these. They just lost their homes and now they have no place to sleep. This after hour days of sifting through the rubble looking for their friends, their relatives, their neighbors, hoping to find signs of life before it’s too late. People’s home, people’s memories, people’s lives. In Turkey, more than six thousand buildings crumbled or up smoke amid more than thirteen hundred aftershocks. Many of them in corners of the country so remote. Help is hard to come by. To see them, we head to more than two hundred miles east towards frontier city of Adiyaman along a road littered with the aftermath of the earthquake and the faint glimmers of hope at what used to be an apartment building. We were just told that a seventeen high school girl is still alive beneath the rubble. She managed to message a friend of hers to tell her that. So rescuers are working bucket by bucket with their bare hands piece by piece try to rescue her and anyone else who might still be alive. In many ways, it’s even more dire in war-torn Syria where today, four days after the earthquake, aid has finally arrived. But amid the freezing cold, shortage of food and dwindling heating, the aftermath warns the World Health Organization could prove even more deadly than the earthquake itself. The WHO says that’s because the earthquake disrupted basic distribution of things like water, food, fuel, electricity, communications. Simply put when it comes to what people need more of here it is absolutely everything.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 02.08.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.08.23/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Feb 2023 20:58:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.08.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, President B is taking his message directly to voters, one day after delivering his State of the Union Address to a combative crowd of Republican lawmakers. The president’s trip to the battleground state of Wisconsin is a kickoff of what’s expected to be his 2024 re-election bid. Plus, tonight, we’ve got our exclusive interview with the Secretary of Defense, L.A. You are going to want to hear what he has to say about that Chinese spy balloon and why he was concerned about America’s nuclear arsenal. But first, the death toll continues to rise across Turkey and Syria, at this hour surpassing twelve thousand since Monday’s massive earthquake. The WHO warning tonight that number could reach twenty thousand killed. At least three US citizen are among the dead. Rescue teams are digging through rubbles of collapsed buildings, bucket by bucket in a desperate search for survivors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rescuers are sleeplessly peeling back the fourteen stories of apartment building that came crashing down behind me. So far, none of the twenty eight families who lived here have been found alive, but these bulldozers and cranes are not giving up. Sometimes, bottle caps are more powerful than bulldozers. Some people were sleeping inside when this building collapsed. International help is on the way including American search and rescue teams who arrived here today. The only road the UN authorizes to carry supplies from Turkey to Syria is now mangled by the earthquake. The search and rescue effort continues behind me, and it could not be more urgent. The first three days after an earthquake offer the best opportunity for finding survivors, and the sun has just set on day three.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 02.07.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.07.23/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Feb 2023 22:07:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.07.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;President B is set to address the nation tonight likely to what is going to be the largest television audience of the year for him. He’ll be touting his accomplishments. And we’ve just learned that he will directly address Republicans, urging them to work with him. The other major news tonight is about the quick-thinking flight attendants preventing a midair disaster after a fire started right after takeoff. Tonight, what caused the fire, we’ll have more on that in just a moment. But we want to begin with overseas. Time is running out for victims buried in Turkey and Syria after that massive earthquake with the death toll of at least nearly eight thousand. Officials are warning the end of critical three day timeframe to rescue the people is approaching, and freezing conditions are making the research effort even more difficult. And we’re seeing these heartbreaking scenes like this one, a grieving father hold the hands of his fifteen-year-old daughter who died when their apartment building collapsed. A US Air Force plane loaded with supplies and members of an urban search and rescue team from Virginia took off just this morning headed to the disaster zone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The devastation is hard to fathom. Nearly six thousand buildings destroyed just like this one behind me as the rescue effort goes on. And according to UNICEF, thousands of children could be trapped or killed beneath buildings like this one across the devastated area. But tonight, there are also extraordinary images of babies surviving despite impossible odds.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 02.06.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.06.23/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Feb 2023 19:16:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.06.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;There are new developments tonight in the Chinese balloon stories that the Pentagon revealing today the US navy has collected a majority of that Chinese aircraft shut down over the weekend off the South Carolina coast. And the senior US general responsible for bringing down that balloon, making a stunning mission, there were four more spy balloons. One under President J.B and three during the T administration. We’re going to have more on that in just a moment. The other big headline, officials in Ohio and Pennsylvania are closely monitoring that toxic situation after a train derailed. Communities are under investigation orders and some people refused to leave home. But first, nearly four thousand people are dead after a 7.8 magnitude earthquake hit Turkey and Syria. The death toll is climbing after the collapse of thousands of buildings. Rescue crews are still searching for survivors. So far nearly eight thousand people had been rescued. The United States joining more than twenty other countries to pledge aids in support of Turkey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As many as twenty thousand people may have been killed according to the World Health Organization. Now, that initial powerful quake struck just after 4 A.M as most people were sleeping followed by unusually strong second earthquake and dozens of aftershocks. Buildings collapse faster than people can flee, killing thousands and trapping countless more. This little girl was one of those lucky ones to escape. Others still trapped beneath their crumbling homes post videos to social media, begging for help. On the surface, a grandmother desperately searches for her daughter and eighteen-month-old grandson. The bitter cold and snow are making rescue efforts even more grueling. Tens of thousands of wounded crowds into hospitals. Children shake from both freezing temperatures and the trauma as the death toll balloons. Around the epicenter, little has been spared. Gaziantep’s historic castle which for more than two millennia now in ruins. The president of Turkey is calling it his country’s worst disaster in more than eighty years. On the border with Syria, it’s a region that’s riddled with fault lines and civil war. After more than a decade of dodging bombs and gunfire, the white helmet volunteers must once again pull small survivors from the rubble.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 02.03.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.03.23/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Feb 2023 18:42:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.03.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, there is a life-threatening brutal arctic blast of cold air and strong winds that are sending temperatures plunging for tens of millions. Our forecast tonight in just a moment. Plus, the other big story tonight, a Marine veteran working as an American aid worker killed in Ukraine in an ambulance while trying to help some civilians. Tonight, we speak with his widow about his heroic actions as Russian missiles rain down. But first, all eyes are on the sky tonight, tracking that Chinese balloon as there are new questions about what the Chinese are spying on? The White House tonight saying it’s keeping all options on the table, the Pentagon revealing they don’t believe there are any weapons on board. And yet it’s another hit to the already strained relationship between the US and China. And now, America’s top diplomats postponing a high-profile trip to Beijing just this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chinese balloon is enormous, carrying a payload of cameras and antennas as big as two or three school buses. It’s powered by solar panels and steered by a rudder as the prevailing winds push it east across the United States at an altitude of sixty thousand feet. China says it’s simply a weather balloon that lost its way. But US officials don’t believe it. And the reason Secretary of State B canceled his trip to meet with China’s President Xi. It came over the Aleutian Islands in Canada, passed over Montana, where intercontinental ballistic missiles are based. Today, it was spotted over Missouri where commercial pilots were warned to be on the knockout. One official told CBSN President B initially wanted to shoot it down, but the Pentagon leaders said it was too risky.

President B was briefed. Fighter jets scrambled and there was a discussion at the highest levels of our government about shooting it down. Well, tonight, the big question, what kind of intelligence were the Chinese trying to collect? Plus, the symbolic and dire warning today from Russian President V.P as he renewing threats to use nuclear weapons against the US and western countries. But first, dangerous polar vortex that’s causing temperatures to plunge across much of the country. Tens of millions of Americans will see some of the coldest conditions in decades. Windchill advisories and warnings stretch across seventeen states from Montana to New England. Some areas could see feels-like temperatures of fifty degrees below zero. In the south, hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses remain without power following three days of ice, sleet and snow. At least eleven deaths are being blamed on icy road conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minneapolis is bracing for frigid freeze tonight. The wind chill is going to make it feel like twenty-five degrees below zero. This as the south finally begins to warm up.

&lt;p&gt;Loved ones remember T.N as a man who touched people throughout his life. That legacy carries on even in his death. Nearly one thousand mourners in Memphis today to say goodbye to T.N including Vice President K.H who sat with N’s family. N died January 10th, three days after he was brutally beaten by five police officers who were all part of a specialized scorpion street crime unit. They are all facing multiple charges including secondary murder. We’re are now learning that four of the five former officers charged in the assault had prior complaints. The Department reprimanded D.M Jr. following a 2019 arrest for failing to file a report about the use of physical force he used in making an arrest. Three years ago, N moved to Memphis to be closer to this mother. He had a four-year-old son and worked the second shift at FedEx with his stepfather. His mother says he was an avid skateboarder who loves sunset.

Also tonight, our reporting on the money mystery surrounding embattled Republican Congressman G.S, new questions about how he financed his race and the source of five hundred thousand dollars in campaign cash. But first, a powerful winter storm is blanketing more than a dozen states with heavy snow, strong winds and rains. The same system brought tornadoes to the Gulf Coast knocked out power to thousands in Arkansas and Missouri. More than half of a foot of snow is already on the ground over nine hundred miles stretch from Oklahoma to Michigan. The snow will fall through the night in up state of New York and northern New England. Residents on the outskirts of Houston, they are still picking up the pieces after a tornado tore an eighteen-mile-long path of destruction to the communities in Deer Park and Pasadena.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amid the destruction of homes like this, it’s now confirmed that one of the tornadoes that touched down here was a powerful EF3. The first blow from the storm now delivered severe weather to the eastern part of the country. A midweek mess, more than a foot of heavy snow fall across parts of Arkansas, causing this truck to jackknife near Fayettevile and cutting power, leaving near one hundred thousand people in the dark. Heavy snow blanketed Ohio, Indiana, Illinois and Missouri with the governors declared state of emergency. In Michigan, the snow led to several fatal accidents around Kalamazoo. Tonight, winter weather alerts stretch across thirteen states but not in Philadelphia or New York City which haven’t seen measurable snow since March of last year. In Texas, when the storm started no shortage of frightening moments. And the National Weather Service says it’s the first time it’s ever issued what’s called a tornado emergency for the Houston area.

Also making headlines tonight, the Pentagon preparing to send dozens of US made M1 tanks to Ukraine. Move that would mean a major step to army in Ukrainian military as they plan a new offensive to drive out Russia. The news tonight on the other Europeans countries that will also send tanks.

But at this hour, it’s the tornado watches and warnings that in effects from Texas to Florida with multiple tornadoes touching down near Houston including one that caused damage and the suburb of Deer Park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The threat of tornadoes has been looming all day here in southeast Texas. And late this afternoon, as you can see here behind me, it became very real. A tornado cut the path through community of Pasadena outside Houston late this afternoon. Crumbling buildings like this gym and cutting powerlines in some areas. High winds damaged this chemical plant in nearby Deer Park. Sirens warned of the approaching storm as residents were urged to take shelters. Strong winds flipped over trucks and flooded streets on other parts of the Houston area. Right now, people here are assessing the damage.

And we were supposed to be in a celebration for the Lunar New Year, instead turning into a massacre. Well today, the death toll growing, eleven people killed and nine others injured. And what we’re learning tonight about some of the victims all over the age of fifty. A second shooting was prevented by a twenty-six-year-old, seen in these surveillance tape. Tonight, our interview with his father who owns the Lai Lai Ballroom. Tonight, police are still searching for a motive after the suspected gunman, seventy-two-year-old H.C.T died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound as investigators closed in. And late this afternoon, police say they recovered forty-two bullet casings inside the studio that’s right behind me. And in that second studio, police found a nine millimeter semiautomatic handgun which was wrestled away from him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re just hearing from investigators. They now believe the suspect was manufacturing weapons at his home. And as the investigation continues, they are trying to piece together the motive here. We know they are looking at jealousy or potential domestic dispute that could have been contributing factors. The hunt for investigators nearly eighty miles from the scene of the deadly shooting to suspect, H.C.T’s Hemet, California home, where Sheriff’s deputies served a search warrant overnight. Those killed ranged in age from their fifties to seventies. The shooting was reported at 10:22. And seventeen minutes later at 10:39, the suspect entered a second dance hall about three miles away.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 01.22.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.22.23/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jan 2023 19:59:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.22.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, a lunar new year celebration in a California city erupted into chaos overnight. The festive atmosphere shattered by yet another shooting in this country. This time, police say ten people were killed and ten more injured at a ball room dance studio in Monterey Park. It’s about seven miles from Los Angeles. The gunman fled the scene leading to a mass manhunt and swat team member surrounding this white van. Investigator released a photo of suspect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two active crime scenes near Los Angeles at this hour. One here the shooting scene at Monterey Park and another just thirty miles away in Torres where a white van believed to be significant to this case has being discovered. A hail of gunfire, a race to save lives, ending manhunt. The shooting at a Monterey Park dance club Saturday night came as the community celebrated the lunar new year. Police say five women and five men were killed when the gunman opened fire on the ground. Dozens inside scrambled to the exit. Many thought the shots were fireworks. The gunman fled in what the sheriff officials say was a white cargo van. Less than twenty minutes later in nearby Alhambra, reports that a group of people managed to disarmed a gunman at a dance studio there. About twelve hour later, in twenty seven miles away in the city of Torrance, a swat team surrounded and eventually entered this white van, more where they say they found the gunman dead.

Tonight, the president’s lawyer say six more documents with classification markings have been found after the FBI was giving full access to Mr. B’s Wilmington, Delaware home. Their search Friday lasted nearly thirteen hours. The Bs were not present. Authorities also took possession of other material and handwritten notes. A special counsel has been appointed to investigate. Now, to the renewed battle over abortion rights. Today, abortion proponents gathered in San Francisco. This weekend marks fifty years since the Roe versus Wade decision gave the Americans the constitutional rights to abortion, a decision that was overturned last summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abortion right does remain at the forefront of our national debate here in Washington, in the states and ahead of the 2024 presidential race. Evangelical leader F.B, son of the famed B.G, was one of the thousands of antiabortion activists who turned up in Washington Friday for the March For Life, arguing that the end of R is not the end of their fight. But the persistence from conservatives on abortion comes as Republicans are at a crossroads. Some, like former President D.T have blamed last year’s disappointing election results on the abortion issue being poorly handled by Republicans. But in the early days of 2024 presidential race, possible T rivals are shaking their heads at T’s assessment and tilting to the right. And the issue has sparked an informal policy standoff among those who might run for president. But many attending the march acknowledged the politics of this issue, long highly charged, remain complicated. Meanwhile, fifty years after R.V.W, Vice President K.H will be in Tallahassee, Florida on Sunday, to deliver a major speech on abortion rights as Democrats continue to push on this issue as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 01.20.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.20.23/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jan 2023 19:42:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.20.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight and this week, the marches across America as this Sunday marks fifty years since the Supreme Court ruled on R.V.W. That anniversary observed for the first time since the landmark decision on abortion was overturned. Plus, an important health update on D.H as his team, the Buffalo Bills, prepares for a rematch against the Cincinnati Bengals. That important playoff game is going to be right here on CBS. But we do want to begin tonight with those major layoffs in Silicon Valley. Google’s parent company Alphabet, announcing today it will cut twelve thousand positions. That is six percent of its workforce. The tech giant’s biggest ever round of layoffs come during the same week that Microsoft and Amazon also announced job cuts. Nationwide, companies are cost-cutting amid concerns about slowing economy and pending recession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight, Google’s CEO is taking responsibility for the massive layoffs, saying the company hired for a different economic reality than the one it’s facing today. Tonight, massive layoffs, twelve thousand people losing jobs at Google’s parent company, Alphabet. Just the latest tech company to slash its workforce. Big tech went on an aggressive hiring boom during pandemic. Some of the world’s wealthiest companies added tens of thousands to the payrolls. But cuts are now sweeping the industry. Microsoft this week, saying it would lay off ten thousand, Amazon shedding as many as eighteen thousand. And Facebook parent company, Meta, cutting eleven thousand, thirteen percent of its workforce. Twitter, Salesforce and Wayfair also eliminating jobs. Tech sector losing more than seventy thousand jobs in the past year. The reckoning comes amid recession fears, rising interest rates and frustration.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 01.19.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.19.23/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jan 2023 18:59:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.19.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, we are tracking two winter storms, one of them heading to New England late tonight, and tomorrow bringing snow, freezing rain and sleet. Also tonight, we have the story of a pre-dawn raid, and law enforcement’s crack down on fentanyl. CBSN was there today as more than forty officers ready to raid a home in Arizona where they believe the dangerous drug were being made. But first, more than one year after that shocking shooting on an American film site, today, the dramatic ending in the investigation that led to one of the most well-known actors in America facing criminal charges. Prosecutors brought involuntary manslaughter charges against A.B after the fatal shooting as cinematographer H.H in 2021. The sixty-four-year-old, Academy Award nominee had denied responsibility for the shooting, and says he thought that the gun was unloaded, while the film’s weapon specialist H.G.R, she is facing the same charges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If convicted, B could face up to five years in jail. The DA here plans to formally file those charges in the coming days. But you won’t see B in handcuffs. There won’t be a perp walk. Instead, he will be receiving court summons. What B’s lawyer calls a miscarriage of justice, Santa Fe’s district attorney calls preventable and criminal. In a statement, H’s family praised the decision to bring charges. But in a civil settlement, her husband joined Rust as an executive producer, filming was supposed to resume this month. Tonight, the production company wouldn’t comment if that’s actually going to happen.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 01.18.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.18.23/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jan 2023 20:30:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.18.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, there are new details in that case of a missing mom, her husband accused of murdering her. Well, he’ being held without bail tonight. And the investigators are now lying out a timeline of his alleged Google searches. The day of her disappearance at 4:55 AM police say B.W searched “how long before a body starts smell”. Plus in Ukraine, more on that tragic helicopter crash. President B and the First Lady sending their condolences tonight after fourteen were killed, including the highest ranking Ukrainian officials to die since the invasion began. But first, the weather threat that is facing tens of millions of Americans across the country. In Colorado, the biggest January snowstorm in more than three decades. It dropped a foot of snow in the Denver area. Interstate 70 was shut down in both directions after a multi-vehicle pileup. And in the South, there are reports of a tornado in Southern Arkansas. Four states on alert tonight, with tornado watches in effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some severe storms, like we saw produce damage in Arkansas, could put their way into Tennessee and Mississippi through the rest of evening, watching for strong winds and potential tornado touchdowns as well. That area highlighted in red most likely to see the storms, but here is the good news. That storm line looks to weaken as it pushes through Georgia and the Carolinas early tomorrow and through the day on Thursday. However, severe weather could rear its ugly head across the Ohio River Valley, including places like Columbus, Cleveland Detroit and Pittsburgh. That storm then pushes across the Northeast through the rest of the day tomorrow. The snow is there from the upper Midwest over into the Northeast where as much as five to eight more inches is in the forecast here. Then we watch for the next one come in toward the weekend and beyond, as that low tracks along I-70 and eventually into Northeast still looking for our first measurable snow of the season here in places like New York as well as Philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 01.17.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.17.23/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jan 2023 20:42:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.17.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, there are alarming new details about what the mayor of Albuquerque is calling politically motivated shootings. A failed Republican candidate is under arrest accused of hiring men to shoot at the homes of Democratic lawmakers. Plus, CBSN has new details on the timelines of the special counsel’s investigation into President B’s handling of classified documents. But first, we want to talk about those major storms pummeling the west coast and the aftermath as California crumbles. More than five hundred mudslides have already been reported and the danger continues even when the rains stops falling. That’s because the soils and hills are saturated, increasing the risk of landslides, mudslides and sinkholes. California governor saying today at least twenty people have died from the storms and President B is set to tour the damage on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is destruction from north of San Francisco to south of San Diego. Take a look at this, the ground beneath this road gave out. The crew is working to repair this mountain highway tell us damage stretches here more than thirty miles and that is the story across the Golden State night. The deluge has stopped, but the danger continues. A mudslide stopped this commuter train in its tracks on the tracks. More than two hundred passengers onboard had to be evacuated. In Berkely, mud poured through M.C’s home of more than twenty years, one of eight in the area deemed unlivable. Since New Year’s, California has experienced more than five hundred landslides spanning the entire state from the mountains to the coast. On 2005, this slide on a clear morning swallowed up the community of La Conchita, 10 people died.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 01.16.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.16.23/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jan 2023 19:50:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.16.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, we are learning more about the investigation into that near collision of two passenger planes at JFK airport in New York, putting lives of more than three hundreds at risk. Plus, one of the deadliest days for civilians in Ukraine since the war began. At least forty people were killed including three children after a Russian missile attack on an apartment building in Dnipro. How the US is responding. But first, President B is facing growing criticism tonight from both parties after the newest discoveries of classified material at his home in Delaware. And after demands from White House Republicans for visitor logs to that property. We are learning new information tonight there are no logs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The document disclosures continued this weekend, and what’s become an expanding legal and political headache for the White House. The president today ignored questions about the disclosure of five more classified pages at his Wilmington home as the demand for answers from the White House from both parties increased. In a letter, House Oversight Committee Chairman, J.C, told White House Chief of Staff, R.K, the White House must provide the Wilmington residence visitor logs. But a White House spokesman told CBSN there is no such thing. Like every president across decades of modern history, his personal residence is personal. The latest disclosure of classified materials came Saturday, when White House counsel R.S announced he had gone to the Wilmington house Thursday evening to handover a single page document found earlier. Democrats are also voicing concerns. President and vice president can take classified records home with little accounting of what they have and where, says former acting CIA Director M.M. At the end of the administration, both classified and unclassified government documents belonging to president or vice president must be turned over to the National Archives.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 01.15.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.15.23/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Jan 2023 19:22:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.15.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Today, President B became the first sitting president to speak during a Sunday service at Atlanta’s historic E. Baptist Church, where Dr. M.L.K once served as pastor. Speaking to parishioners, the president reiterated a theme he called on before, redeeming the soul of America. A dream in which we all deserve liberty and justice. And it’s still the task of our time to make that dream a reality because it’s not there yet. But in our nation’s capital, the president faces political nightmares. This weekend’s disclosure that more classified documents had been found is powering Republican plans for investigations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, questions are still swirling here in Washington about the handling, or mishandling of classified materials, one day after the White House says five more pages were discovered. President J.B ignored questions while boarding Air Force One Sunday as the drumbeat grows louder for him to answer for the classified documents discovered at his Delaware residence. On Saturday, White House attorney R.S said the additional pages were found on Thursday and given to the Justice Department. The discovery came just hours after Attorney General M.G appointed former U.S attorney R.H as special counsel. White House officials maintain they’re handling the legal matters by the book. But House Republicans have launched investigation of their own into how this happened, asking the White House for visitor logs from the Wilmington residency and pouncing on what they call a double standard comparing to the DOJ’s probe to the former President T.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 01.14.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.14.23/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Jan 2023 21:02:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.14.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with the growing political firestorm over President J.B’s handling of classified information. Today, a new disclosure, more classified documents were discovered at Mr. B’s Delaware home from his time as Vice President. So far, we know roughly twenty classified records that have been uncovered in two locations. This week’s revelations, first reported by CBSN come as the president approaches a difficult reelection bid and as the White House struggles to contain the damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, a top White House lawyer says they found more documents with classified markings at President B’s home. Those documents are now in the hands of the Department of Justice. Departing for his Delaware home Friday, the President ignored reporters’ questions about the DOJ inquiry into his handling, or possible mishandling classified material. It’s the same Wilmington residence White House attorney R.S says he visited Thursday to supervise the handover of one document found in a room adjacent to the garage. S says, while there, five additional pages with classified markings were discovered for a total of six pages. DOJ officials on site immediately took possession of the documents according to his statement. This week, Attorney General M.G announced the appointment of Special Counsel R.H to head the investigation. Something that White House says it was not informed about in advance. The first documents were discovered in November, but the White House did not go public about the issue until Monday. The same day CBSN broke the story, frustrating fellow Democrats. Housing Republicans expressing outrage this week, announcing their own investigations.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 01.13.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.13.23/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Jan 2023 20:32:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.13.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, there is new details on the probe into the handling of the president’s classified documents including the total number that were found. But there are still so many questions and the president today refusing to answer questions on it. Plus, the new spotlight on Ukraine as Russia unleashed one of its billionaire oligarchs and his private army of mercenaries. But, we do want to begin with those devastating tornadoes. Dozens of twisters left behind destruction in at least seven states. The most extensive damage is in Alabama, where seven deaths were reported after just one tornado torn through two different communities. Entire neighborhoods are destroyed, homes blown apart and trees snapped in half. With debris, you can see scattered for miles. The destruction continued into Georgia where at least two people were killed, including a five-year-old. Meanwhile, California residents still bracing for even more storms after weeks of torrential rains and mass flooding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Storms ripped through Alabama and Georgia yesterday, knocking over this building which was a daycare and snapping trees. The wind here was at least one hundred and fifteen miles per hour, shattering brick and twisting metal. And the people who tried to ride it out in this daycare thought they were going to die. The storm was part of the system that battered California this week, with more to come.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 01.12.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.12.23/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jan 2023 20:54:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.12.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, a new and serious investigation into President B’s classified documents after we learned more of American secrets were turned over just this morning. Plus, the new information we are just getting in about L.M.P, her mom, P is saying today about her condition after the only child of E.P suffered cardiac arrest. But first, nearly twenty million Americans are under threat of severe storms in the south. This afternoon, a large and extremely dangerous tornado tore apart homes, leaving a trail of destruction in its path in Selma, Alabama. Tornadoes warnings have been posted in several counties north of the capital city of Montgomery as the storms are moving east. This is part of the same storm system that brought torrential rains and flood waters to much of California earlier in the week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A confirmed midafternoon tornado near Atlanta’s airport led to the second ground stop in as many days here. No flights in or out for roughly half an hour. All part of a storm-tossed Thursday across the south. Salma, Alabama, the bull’s eye of a powerful tornado ripping through the city, causing major damage. A line of large tornadoes swept through the south, touching down in central and eastern Kentucky. Roofs blown off, cars flipped on their sides, a trail of ruin, striking in the middle of the day, causing misery in Mississippi. Southern states ravaged as the toll continues to mount in the west.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 01.11.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.11.23/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jan 2023 21:49:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.11.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Airports and travelers are still feeling the effects after a stunning computer outage that grounded all domestic flights, leaving questions about what could have costs this. Plus, another big headline tonight, Congressman G.S says he will not step down despite growing calls to resign from members of his own party and a new resume that is full of lies that he’s admitted to telling. But we want to begin with some surprising information that we just received this afternoon. Another batch of B documents with classified markings were found. Today, the White House and the president’s lawyers wouldn’t answer simple questions about those documents including what’s in them and we’ll learn more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight, we are learning that as part of the Justice Department’s review, officials looked at the possibility of classified documents at other locations. And sources tell us, the number of sensitive documents found is larger than initially believed. CBSN has learned that documents marked classified from J.B’s ten-year as V.P were founded at least one additional location. The revelation follows the initial discovery of roughly ten classified document including November last year at the P.B.C in this building across from the Capitol. A source tells CBSN those documents contained highly classified material and briefings. Tonight, the White House declined to answer repeated questions about when the president learned about the first batch of classified documents and why the discovery wasn’t disclosed sooner, citing the Justice Department review. CBSN has learned that the president wasn’t informed of the classified documents on November 2 of last year, the same day they were found. The White House didn’t disclosed information until Monday, more than two months later, after requests from CBSN. The White House says proper protocols were followed. The materials were recovered by the National Archives the next day. And the Justice Department was notified. This comes five months after investigators seized over a hundred classified documents at former President T’s residents at Mar-a-Lago. House Speaker K.M alleged a double standard. But in T’s case, he refused repeated request to return all his classified documents.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 01.10.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.10.23/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jan 2023 19:06:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.10.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, there is new fallout from what CBSN first reported about those B documents. House Republicans have just launched investigation. We’ve got more on that in just a moment. Plus, this news just coming in, look at this video, smoke pouring out of the wing of this Delta flight. But first, more deadly storms have slammed the California Coast with torrential rains and thunderstorms causing massive flooding, landslides and widespread power outages. At least twenty-five residents are under flood advisories while more than one hundred and forty-five thousand still without power. And as the rain move inland, yet another major storm system will move in right behind it. The governor of California just announced seventeen people have died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The water in this neighborhood is finally starting to recede. Only a couple of inches right here. But to give you some context, the amount of rainfall we’ve received and what’s in forecast, well, that’s enough to cover the entire state of California with fifteen inches of water. The procession of storm is relentless and unforgiving, flooding homes and roads with each new torrential downpour. In Los Angeles, a massive cleanup is underway. Overnight, up to eight inches of rain triggered landslides, leaving behind a pile of mud in Valley neighborhood. A large sinkhole created by the rainfall swallowed two cars. A mother and daughter had to be rescued. Even train commuters had to navigate flood waters inside Union Station. In northern California, this is what a stretch of the busy 101 freeway near San Francisco looks like. Meanwhile, a rising Sacramento river heightened concerns as crews patrolled levees around the clock, looking for any signs of trouble. The record weather is also wreaking havoc on the Central Coast.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 01.09.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.09.23/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jan 2023 17:46:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.09.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Well, tonight, there is breaking news that Justice Department is looking into classified documents founded at private office once belonging to J.B. And it comes as he is in Mexico for a meeting with world leaders. Plus, just days after being sworn into office, more legal trouble or New York Republican Congressman J.S. But first, residents are bracing for another round of severe storms. Residents are cleaning up from last week’s bomb cyclone that flooded streets, knocked out power, and resulted in at least twelve deaths over the last ten days. Well, tonight, ninety percent of the state’s population is under a flood watch, with officials telling residents in several counties to leave and get to higher ground. President B has issued an emergency declaration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A short break in the rain here, but so much damage has already been done. Along the coast here Santa Cruz, the storm surge and really high surf, wiped out part of this beachfront road. You can see it’s just gone. And these record-breaking downpours, well, they’re wreaking havoc across the state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California is drowning, the ground now is so saturated water has nowhere to go but up. In the town of Felton, several homes now under water as the San Lorenzo river overflows, prompting rescues in the fast-moving current. Mud-soaked hillsides are coming down. This one is blocking the highway into Santa Cruz. The San Lorenzo is just one of several rivers now at or above flood stage. This map shows widespread the risk is. Many flooded roads in San Francisco Bay area are impassable. High wind and high water uprooted trees. Just in the past ten days, Oakland, California has more rain than it normally gets in the entire season. The brunt of the storm is now taking aim on southern California.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 01.08.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.08.23/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jan 2023 21:23:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.08.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;There is breaking news on several fronts tonight. New storms threaten life and property in California. And President B faced sharp criticism today during his visit to the southern border. But we begin in Brazil. Tonight, authorities announced they are in control of the country’s national congress, supreme court and presidential palace. Those places were stormed by a mob of thousands today. Supporters of former far-right President J.B refused to accept his election defeat. They broke through barricades and battled police in the capital Brasilia. They even demanded the military oust the new democratically elected President L.I.L. He condemned today’s events as a fascist attack. In a video posted to social media. The mob you seen right there attacking a police officer on horseback, pulling him to the ground. No more yet on his condition. B, meanwhile, has made unfounded claims, the election was stolen. He left Brazil for Florida in late December. Well, to California now, tonight bracing for a new round of powerful storms. The first roaring ashore late tonight. The extreme weather already claiming lives and now threatening millions more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relentless storms are now to blame for at least seven deaths across the state. Tonight, while the clouds move in, new fears as California sits in the path of serious cyclones.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 01.07.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.07.23/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Jan 2023 19:30:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.07.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;It took ballots and some heated moments. But tonight, Congress finally has a new House Speaker. K.M won earlier this morning, putting an end to days of raucous debate and a historic standoff with emboldened hardline Republicans, the GOP strife playing out for all to see and ending with arm twisting, flaring tempers and phone calls from the former President D.T.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was certainly a late night here on Capitol Hill. Today, President B called Speaker M to congratulate him on his victory. And overnight, the White House released a statement saying the president is prepared to work with House of Republicans to quote “ensure that we’re putting the interest of American families first”. After four days, fourteen failed votes, and a furious Friday night negotiation. The Speaker is in the House. In order to grab the gavel, the new speaker made several concessions including making it easier for any members to oust him and giving his more conservative Republicans opponents two seats on the Rules Committee. The first looming concern seems to be the debt ceiling. Look, those six holdouts have already said they’re not going to authorize an increase in America’s credit limit without specific spending cuts. And those spending cuts they want are likely to put them on a collision course with Democrats the Senate and the White House potentially putting American credit rating at risk.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 01.06.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.06.23/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Jan 2023 20:19:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.06.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, some intriguing news in the murders of four college students in Idaho, we are just learning that mattresses were removed from the crime scene. We’ll get more on that in just a minute. Plus, today is January 6th, the second anniversary of the attack in the US Capitol. President B today marking the occasion with emotional ceremony and honoring fourteen Americans for their courage and selflessness in defending democracy. But first, the fight for Speaker of the House could soon be coming to an end. Republican leader K.M boasting he will have enough votes by late tonight to become speaker, telling reporters “You’ll be calling me the comeback kid”. This comes after gaining momentum today by winning over fourteen far right republicans. It has been an historic weekend of discord playing out in front of the American people with the most roll call votes for a speaker since 1859, that’s prior to the Civil War.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leader M started the day telling CBSN he will shock us. And he has managed to gain some grounds after reaching a tentative deal with some of his opponents. In a dramatic turn of events on the house floor. Cheers erupted one by one. As fourteen Republicans flipped their votes for GOP Leader K.M. Even though, he’s still short it’s the most votes M managed to get all week after more than a dozen failed ballots. The M momentum shifted after a deal worked out among a handful of holdouts in the conservatives House Freedom Caucus, including Pennsylvania’s S.P. It’s the framework of an agreement in good faith that allows us keep moving forth. The tentative deal includes broad changes on spending, additional seats on key house panels and a provision that allows any one member to call for a motion to remove the speaker. At least six hardliners are still keeping M from getting the votes, including Florida’s M.G who drew boos on the floor and prompted some M backers to walk out. Unless M can pick off more of those no votes, he still won’t be able to get the job. But he told reporters that he is confident that he can get it done tonight when the house meets for another voting.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 01.05.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.05.23/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Jan 2023 19:31:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.05.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, there is promising news from doctors about Buffalo Bill’s safety D.H. They say today marks a really turning point in his recovery. Plus, that Republican revolt in the House of Representatives continues for the third straight day as a small group of members hold K.M’s speakership hostage. But first, we have so many new details in the murders of four University of Idaho students, it was this affidavit was released today and it reviews how police identified the suspect, twenty-eight-year-old B.K. Police say they found this DNA on a knife sheath, which investigators believe is connected to the murder weapon. Police also revealing today, they identified the suspect by tracking his car on surveillance cameras. Today, K made his first court appearance in Idaho to face four charges of first degree murder in the stabbing deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight, many questions were answered. Some people may have thought the case gone cold but it turns out police were tracking the suspect for a very long time. We are also learning how investigators connected K to the scene. K smiled at his court-attorney and appeared calm as gruesome new details were revealed about how he may have stalked the victims and how police tracked him down through DNA, phone records and a witness. In a court document released today, police say DNA from trash obtained from K’s home in Pennsylvania matched DNA on a knife sheath found next one to a victim’s body. Also in the document, a roommate identified as D.M told police she thought she heard K.G say “there’s someone here” around 4 A.M. M told police after hearing someone crying and a man saying something to the effect “It’s okay, I’m going to help you”. She opened her door and saw a figure clad in black clothing and a mask covered the person’s mouth and nose walking towards her.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 01.04.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.04.23/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jan 2023 19:59:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.04.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, Republicans are deadlocked in disarrayed House of Representatives over the battle for a new speaker. Make no mistake, what we are witnessing is historic. Some Republican lawmakers tonight accusing far right members of holding the people’s businesses hostage as they voted over and over to reject leader M for Speaker of the House. Plus, tonight, there is new information and new video of the suspect on the brutal killings of those four University of Idaho students. But first, a major storm known as atmosphere river is dropping mass amounts of rain across California to the Oregon border. Sandbags are in short supplies across northern California. The mother of nature could drop more than ten inches of rain in some areas. The governor today declaring a state of emergency and driver is warned to stay off the roads as flood waters could quickly turn into a life-threatening situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight, already wind gust reaching thirty miles per hour. They could end up more than double when the worst of the storm hits later on tonight. It will last more than twenty-four hours. Rain will be the biggest threat. And with roadways already flooded like this, meteorologists are warning it will be brutal and could be deadly. California has already endured a pounding and it’s about to get even worse. In Sacramento County, there is a race to repair breached levees. Today, state officials issued a dare warning. The jet stream now stretching through the pacific all the way to Indonesia. The amount of water funneling straight into California up to fifteen times the flow at the mouth of the Mississippi river. The problem, the ground is so saturated that any rain could cause immediate flooding. In San Francisco, already battled record rainfall, the demand for sandbags is so high, the city has exhausted its supply. Still digging out, time running out. There is good news, more snow in California’s Sierra Nevada in the past decade. The snowpack, vital to its water supply, impacted by years of drought is now one hundred and seventy percent of average. But below the mountains, a muddy mess. And tonight, crews are really working against the clock to repair what they say are five breaks to the levee system. They do not believe they will be able to fix them before the storm arrives.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 01.03.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.03.22/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jan 2023 21:05:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.03.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, there is political chaos in the House of Representatives unlike anything we’ve seen in century after the new Congress adjourns on day one without a new speaker. Plus, the ongoing weather threats, snow, ice and at least a dozen tornadoes have already been reported. But we do want to begin tonight with terrifying scene in Cincinnati before B.B safety D.H collapsed following a tackle. H tonight still in critical condition. His family, in their first statement are asking please keep D in your prayers. In an emotional display, players from both teams surrounded H, you can see the tears on the faces of some of his teammates. Now, outside the hospital, Bills and Bengals fans gathered together to show support. The game was postponed and the NFL tonight says the game will not be played this week. Also, in a show of support from the country, H two years ago had created this GoFundMe for his Chasing M’s Foundation, which helps kids in his hometown in Pittsburgh. Well, his goal back then was twenty-five hundred dollars. We can report tonight it is now at five million dollars and growing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D.H’s uncle says that his nephew’s heart stopped twice, once on the field and the again here at the hospital. But, Doctors at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center have provided any updates. Late Monday, the team said H suffered a cardiac arrest. The game was suspended and eventually postponed, a first for the league. The NFL says their emergency medical plan worked. The league says at every game there are critical care doctors and nearby trauma centers standing by.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 01.02.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.02.23/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jan 2023 20:35:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.02.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, as we begin the broadcast on this first Monday of the new year, thousands of airline passengers are facing more delays after an air traffic control computer glitch. We are going to have an update on that in just a moment. Plus, new details about the man accused of attacking three New York City’s police officers near Times Square in New Year’s Eve, charged today with attempted murder. Authorities are investigating if the suspect was motivated by Islamic extremism. But first, the new year has brought record rainfall, deadly flooding and high winds to northern California. A weather event known as an atmospheric river had dumped nearly half foot of rain in some areas, forcing evacuations in low lying communities. The system is now moving east, stretching from the Rockies to the Great Lakes and to the South bringing tornadoes threats to half a dozen states. We’ll have a forecast in just a moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The storm was so strong, it broke a levee that was recently reinforced to last until the year 2050. It cost twenty million dollars. Tonight, this neighborhood looks like a lake, the flooding will likely only grow as it continues to rain. Too much rain in California all at once. Levees were breached, cars stranded, leading to dozens of rescues, several by helicopter. One driving along this flooded so deceptively deep. At least one death is already blamed on the storm. In Sacramento County, a flood advisory is in place tonight. In San Francisco, nearly five and half inches of rain fell in twenty-four hours this weekend. The second wettest day since the Gold-Rush era, submerging neighborhoods and the iconic Fisherman’s Warf. East of Sacramento, parts of the Sierra Nevada have been pounded by nearly four feet of snow from the latest storm that has now moved into the Rockies, ravaging Colorado, triggering this avalanche at Telluride. A skier died in another at Breckenridge. Possible tornadoes have already caused damage in parts of the south including Arkansas. Today, in California, a small break in the weather officials using the lull to sandbag and brace for the next storm. And tonight, crews are also working to fix that broken levee. Meanwhile, hundreds of people remain under a mandatory evacuation and for good reason. More heavy rain and snow is in the forecast for Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 01.01.23</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.01.23/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jan 2023 20:12:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.01.23/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;A fierce storm has ushered in the new year in California. In Sacramento, it was the wettest New Year’s Eve on record. At least two levees have been overwhelmed. And tonight, the danger is not over. This is Highway 99. It’s a major south roadway where some drivers became trapped, and fast-rising floodwaters led to several rescues throughout the region. The storm is now headed east, bringing the snow to Utah and tornadoes to the south.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s beautiful now in San Francisco. But California is dealing with the aftermath of record-setting rains and high winds. Power is out for tens of thousands of residents across the state, and the danger now is flooding. Tonight, a shelter-in-place order is in effect for parts of Sacramento County amid fears a river levee could fail and flood the small community of Wilton, the town’s five thousand residents told to get to higher ground. It’s all part of a massive storm that battered California, dumping heavy rain, snow and high winds triggering floods, mudslides and power outages. In San Francisco, the famed Fisherman’s Warf was drenched on the wettest day in nearly thirty years. The deluge stranded commuters on a major highway, the 101. Satellite imagery shows the so-called atmospheric river bringing moisture to California, catching many off guards. In Sierra Nevada, up to eight feet of snow blanketed towns, clogged roads and forced many sky resorts to temporarily shut down. But all this moisture is desperately needed to fight the drought. As California digs and dries out, it’s still too early to tell how much this will ease the drought. But experts will be measuring the vital indicator, the snow pack, on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 12.31.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.31.22/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2023 21:07:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.31.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;There is only one pope tonight, B the XVI died today ending an unprecedented decade in which the Catholic Church had two living popes, one reigning, one retired. In 2013, B became the first Pope in six hundred years to resign, saying that at age eighty-five, he was no longer up to the job. His successor, Pope F, is eighty-six. The path could be clear now for him to step down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With B’s death, we are in uncharted water because he was not a sitting pope. However, we do know that starting on Monday, his body will be lying in state. And on Thursday, Pope F will preside over his funeral here at the Vatican which B continue to call home after he shocked the world in 2013 and resigned. Nothing defined B XVI pontificate so clearly as it’s ending, with his majestic farewell flight over the eternal city. B had become the first Pope in more than six hundred years to resign. He said his mental and physical strength had deteriorated to the point he had to quote “recognize my incapacity to fulfill the ministry entrusted to me”. He became Pope at age seventy-eight. He was forced to joined the Hitler Youth at age fourteen, and in 1943 was conscripted into an anti-aircraft unit in a German army. He deserted and was taken prisoner by the Americans. He entered the priesthood after the war, rose to become a cardinal, and earned a nickname Gods Rottweiler, as a rigid enforcer of church policy. Critics hit out at his slow response to the decades of cover-up of the scandal of sexual abuse by priests. And then came the scandal of leaked documents that disclosed corruption and mismanagement in the Vatican. Still, he initiated some changes of the next pope, F, would later get credit for. He began the reform of Vatican finances and was the first pope to meet with victims of sex abuse, and to publicly apologize, condemning what he called filth in the church. When he was ninety-four, a new scandal would threaten his legacy, accusation of misconduct and his handling of sex abuse cases more than four decades earlier when he was Archbishop of Munich. B’s lawyers denied any cover-up and B asked for forgiveness. A scholar who had wanted nothing more than to hide in academia, B made an indelible mark on the church and history when he became the pope who decided it was time to go. With B’s death, F is finally the only pope here. But for how long? He revealed earlier this month that he already has his own resignation letter ready to submit if his own health ever impedes his work.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 12.30.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.30.22/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Dec 2022 19:07:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.30.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, six years of D.T’s tax return have been made public. Thousands of pages of financial documents show staggering losses, questionable deductions and very little pay in federal taxes. Plus, Southwest Airline flights are back on schedule following a week-long meltdown impacting tens of thousands of passengers. But first, a major break in that murder case of four University of Idaho students. Authorities arrested twenty-eight-year-old B.C at his parents’ home in Pennsylvania. He is now facing four counts of first-degree murder. And we still don’t know the motive in the killings of the college students whose deaths sent shockwaves across the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are still a lot of questions, and Idaho law limits whether what the investigators can say at this point. But during a news conference today, they revealed they do not have the murder weapon. They say they have recovered a white Hyundai Elantra that appears to be critical to the case. After nineteen thousand tips in a quadruple murder case that drew nationwide attention. K was arrested at his parent’s Pennsylvania home. The twenty-eight-year-old is a PhD criminology student at Washington State University just a ten-minute drive to the Idaho campus. K been held without bail and will spend the weekend in Pennsylvania. His extradition back to Idaho expected next week. The arrest caps nearly seven weeks of fear and frustration for families of the four murdered students. The district attorney who will eventually prosecute the suspect says an arrest is not meaning an end to the investigation. There are still searching for tips from anyone who knows the suspect. And we should know more after the extradition hearing Tuesday in Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 12.29.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.29.22/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Dec 2022 19:56:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.29.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, the sports world is mourning the passing of soccer superstar Pele at the age of eighty-two. His fellow Brazilian footballer Neymar wrote on Instagram “Pele made soccer art”. Also tonight, embattled New York Congressman elect J.S’s own constituents are calling on him to resign after he lied about his faith and linked to his mother’s death to the 911 attacks. But first, a major snowstorm system moves across the western part of the country. Dumping nearly a foot of snow in parts of Colorado, shutting down an interstate and leaving drivers stranded for more than nine hours. Heading into another holiday weekend, more rain and snow is in the forecast from California to the Rocky Mountains. And a separate system will bring heavy rain to much of the east coast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The forecast called for about two inches. By daybreak, more than seven had blanketed Denver and stranded hundreds in the mountain pass along Interstate seventy. You can see the snow drifts piled high, and none of it was here yesterday at this time. At the height of this latest storm. Snow is falling at the rate of two inches an hour. And we’re bracing here, a lot more is on the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Buffalo tonight, major roads have reopened as driving ban has been lifted. It comes five days after the blizzard of the century paralyzed that city.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 12.28.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.28.22/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Dec 2022 19:17:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.28.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We have some breaking news from the B administration, the Centers for Disease Control announced new Covid 19 testing requirements for all airlines passengers traveling from China. Plus, federal and local prosecutors opened investigations to embattle Congressman elect G.S who admitted to lying about his background. And while the death toll rises in Buffalo tonight as it digs out from that monster blizzard, the Western part of the country is now being hit by torrential rain, snow and flooding. By first, travel nightmares continue for thousands of the Southwest Airlines passengers who remain stranded following a meltdown of epic proportions. Southwest canceled thousands more flights today and has already scrubbed more than twenty-three hundred flights on their schedule for Thursday. The company’s CEO says it could take until next week before everything turns back to normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, overall, there were more than twenty-eight hundred flights canceled, either within coming in or going out of the US. Eighty seven percent of those cancelations were Southwest Airlines flights. A day filled with challenges for passengers booked to fly on Southwest like sky-high prices for tickets on other airlines. And few available rental cars across the country with Hertz and Enterprise both reporting an increase in demand for one-way rentals. Nothing but tough choices for stranded Southwest passengers who can’t get an agent on the phone. Passengers are entitled to a full cash refund for a canceled flight not just a voucher. But ancillary costs like hotels, rental cars and replacement flights on other carriers are not likely to be reimbursed.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 12.27.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.27.22/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Dec 2022 18:22:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.27.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We have breaking news tonight out of Supreme Court, it ruled Covid 19 border restriction known as Title 42 will remain in effect. Plus, embattled Congressman elect J.S is facing calls to step aside after admitting what he called a little bit of fluff in his resume. But first, we begin with the travel nightmares at the nation’s airports. Bad weather and staff issues have left passengers stranded and luggage piling up. Since Friday, nearly twenty thousand flights have been canceled and almost forty thousand delayed. Southwest Airlines is being hit the hardest accounting for nearly half of the cancelations. And city of Buffalo, New York remains paralyzed for what’s being called the blizzard of the century. Heavy equipment is helping to clear the snow-covered streets as the death toll rises. And on the west coast, the first round from a powerful storm is bringing high wind and drenching rain to Washington, Oregon and California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For passengers on Southwest, the nightmare before Christmas has become the meltdown after Christmas. At airports around the country, the writing is on the monitors. Luggage piled everywhere, Southwest passengers stuck in endless lines at the counter and on the phone. On Christmas Day, Southwest canceled nearly half of its flights. On Monday, it was three quarters with nearly its entire scheduled canceled or delayed. And today, over twenty-five hundred more flights canceled, passengers again out of luck so are flight crews. Crews have to call in to their assignments and waiting on hold for hours. Late today, Transportation Secretary P.B weighed in. He says the Department of Transportation isn’t investigating the circumstances that led to this chaos.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 12.26.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.26.22/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Dec 2022 21:23:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.26.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;National drug chains are limiting the sale of over-the-counter children’s medicine amid a wide spread shortage. Plus, the White House accuses Texas Governor G.A of endangering lives when he dropped off busloads of migrants outside of the vice president’s home on a very cold Christmas Eve. More on those stories in just a moment. But first, a state emergency is in effect tonight in New York State following the deadly blizzard that dropped more than four feet of snow in Buffalo. President B spoke with New York Governor C.H to offer federal assistance and the death toll has risen to at least twenty-seven in the Buffalo area and at least fifty-five nationwide. Driving bans remain in place in several parts of Erie County, New York. And at the nation’s airports, chaos while thousands of cancelations and delays leave some travelers stranded. And it’s not over yet, with even more snow and cold in the forecast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As snow continues to fall, this unrelenting storm has been called once in generation breaking records in western New York, with winds reaching nearly eighty miles per hour. Buffalo buried in four feet of snow; homes sealed in ice. A whiteout farther east in Waterton, New York, with three inches of snow falling per hour. Among the twenty-seven weather-related deaths were three people who trapped in their cars. A travel ban remains in effect in Buffalo area forcing highways closed for a fourth day. Almost every fire truck in the city was stranded in snow at one point over the weekend. It’s the holiday guest no one wanted. Across the country, the winter blast caused roughly 6.4 million customers to lose power and boil water advisories have been issued in the south, including Memphis, Tennessee and Jackson, Mississippi, after pipes burst in freezing temperatures. Luggage, along with frustration, is pilling up at airport across the country, with thousands more flight delays and cancelations today.

&lt;p&gt;At airports across the country, more than twenty-three hundred flights have been canceled with thousands more delayed, the airport in Buffalo, New York is still shut as until at least Tuesday. Christmas in Buffalo, a ghost town, frigid temperatures and fierce winds have trapped people in their homes and car under six feet snow drifts. New York’s governor deployed four hundred members of the National Guards calling it a storm for the ages. Governor H says nearly every fire truck in the city was stranded at one point. Emergency services paralyzed for reaching hardest hit areas. Thirty miles outside Buffalo, up to two hundred people spent Christmas Eve stranded at this Denny’s. It’s a storm so massive and dangerous, about sixty percent of Americans have felt its fury, suffering temperatures far below normal. South Dakota deployed National Guard to assist native American tribes cut off by massive snow falls. Texas went into deep freeze, this car wash now a curtain of icicles.

Plus, there is that massive cross-country storm that is bringing dangerously low temperatures to a majority of the US. But first, we do want to start with that historic day on Capitol Hill. For the first time in American history, Congress has referred a former president to the Department of Justice for a possible criminal prosecution, recommending four felony charges for his role in trying to over the 2020 Presidential election. Now, the statute for one of those charges, insurrection says someone convicted shall be incapable of holding any office under the United States. Plus, we are learning tonight t he warning from Hope Hicks to D.T about violence on January 6th and what the president said in return.

&lt;p&gt;The select committee says it has sufficient evidence that the former president spread false election claims mounted a pressure campaign to overturn the results and was derelict in his duty by failing to call up the rioters on January 6th. The vote was unanimous and unprecedented. At its last public hearing, the January 6th committee issued four criminal referrals against the former President D.T. The recommended charges include obstruction of an official proceeding, conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to make a false statement and incite, assist or aid and comfort an insurrection. The committee also revealed new interviews including with T’s advisor H.H, who told the former president his election fraud claim could damage his legacy. The panel found T’s daughter, I was more forthcoming in her interview and it unveiled additional evidence of potential witness tampering, suggesting at least one witness was offered a job and financial security before testify. The committee also recommended potential prosecution for several T allies, including conservative attorney J.E, former White House Chief of Staff M.M and personal attorney R.G. The committee has referred four GOP lawmakers to the House Ethics Committee for failing to comply with their subpoenas including minority leader K.M.

&lt;p&gt;With thousands of migrants and asylum seekers crossing daily into El Paso, the city is struggling to keep up. R.G runs the largest shelter there. With non-profits and churches reaching full capacity many are forced to sleep outside in below freezing temperature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly two years after the siege of the US Capitol that shocked the Americans, the committee investigating the events of January 6th holds its final public hearing, criminal referrals could be next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, January 6th Committee member A.S said he thinks there is sufficient evidence to charge the former president, although he didn’t want to get ahead of the votes tomorrow. Possible charges could include insurrection, obstruction of an official proceeding and conspiracy to defraud the US government. Now, the former President lashed out at social media platform Truth Social calling on supporters to stand strong against quote “the Thugs and Scoundrels of the Unselect Committee”.

&lt;p&gt;After ten hearings and interviews with more than a thousand witnesses, the January 6th Committee is about to wrap up its work and it could come with serious consequences for members of the past administration. Value in recommending charges, including potentially against former President D.T for his role in events of January 6th. Those charges could include insurrection, obstruction of an official proceeding and conspiracy to defraud the United States government. Adding the T’s troubles, the House Ways and Means Committee will meet next week to decide if it will release portions of his tax returns, which Democrats obtained after a protracted legal battle. And all this is complicating the former president’s plan to run again, leaving uncertainty at the top of the ticket for both parties ahead of 2024.

And it involves possible criminal referrals against D.T. We’ve also just gotten new alarming new data about how severe this flu season has already been. But we are going to begin with final blast of the ice and snow from the massive storm system that emerged on the west coast a week ago. It is now hammering the upper Midwest, upstate New York and northern New England. Power to tens of thousands of homes and businesses has been knocked out, all of this before much of the US falls into what could be a historic deep freeze just in time for the holidays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The snow is still falling here in Windham about three hours North of New York City with another four inches of snow expected tonight. The roads here are treacherous. And by the looks of this, empty street, minus the occasional snowplow, pretty much everyone is opting to stay home. A blast of wintry weather just in time for the holidays. About a foot of snow falling in Greene County north of New York City. And in Connecticut, the plows were working fast to keep up with falling snow. Vermont saw more than a foot in some places with 10 inches turning New Hampshire into a winter wonderland. This coast-to-coast storm dumped four feet of snow in South Dakota. The blizzard stranding travelers at a truck stop motel. In North Dakota, skies were used to traverse the snow-packed roads. With thirty inches snow on the ground on more to come in parts of Minnesota, people are digging out while they can. Even when the snow clears out, icy roads remain. The National Weather Service issued a lake effect snow warnings for the Buffalo, New York area predicting one to three feet of snow this weekend. Forecasters say wind gusts up to thirty-five miles per hour could make roads dangerous there too.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 12.15.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.15.22/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Dec 2022 20:13:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.15.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;There are new details about military fighter jet that crashed in Texas including the condition of the pilot. Plus, we got the latest government move that could ban TikTok from all of its employees’ phones. But we are going to begin with the week-long coast to coast storm that has turned deadly, now barreling towards the finish line in the east. Some parts of the US were blanketed in more than two feet of snow. Tonight, blizzard warnings are posted across the Northern plains and upper Midwest while millions of Americans from the mid-Atlantic to New England are getting a treacherous blast of ice and now. In the south, a massive cleanup is underway after a swarm of deadly tornadoes, twenty-one in Louisiana alone, carved across at least four states and more than one hundred and fifty thousand homes across the storm zones are without power tonight. And crews are working around the clock to get the lights and heat back on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homes across Louisiana are splintered like this one. And here in the New Orleans area, this is the second tornado families have dealt with just this year. They tell us this EF-2 moved quickly leaving them traumatized. The tornado took their roof and shattered most windows. They had just bounced back from Hurricane Ida last year. The tornado outbreak had produced at least forty twisters across the south this week, mostly in Louisiana. In Saint Charles Parish, one woman was killed and eight others hurt when a tornado struck their neighborhood. The storm also triggered a dramatic lightening strike near a nursing home in Laplace. And in New Orleans, strong winds knocked out power for thousands of residents. Further north, the same system is producing heavy snow and dangerous blizzard conditions from the Dakotas to the Great Lakes. Three people were killed near Sioux Falls when a driver lost control. More than two feet of snow fell in Duluth, Minnesota, not a problem for these surfers on a frigid Lake Superior. Now Louisiana is under a state of emergency tonight, and while touring area damage today, the governor said based on the level of destruction. It’s remarkable more people were not hurt.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 12.14.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.14.22/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Dec 2022 18:38:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.14.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;A US border city is on edge tonight as an influx of migrants cross into United States and thousands more are expected in the coming days. Plus, we’ve got our reporting on America’s Fentanyl Crisis. Our search for answers on what is being done to protect our children. But we are going to begin with that coast-to-coast storm that is threatening millions from the northern plains to the Gulf of Mexico. Just moments ago, a tornado touched down just outside New Orleans. As we come on the air, winter alerts are posted from the Rocky Mountains to the Great Lakes as the east coast prepared for a powerful blast of ice, and snow. In the south, the rare outbreak of tornados killed at least three people in Louisiana.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Louisiana is under a state of emergency tonight, the governor says the threat of severe weather is far from over for families across the state. Tonight, a tornado ripping through New Orleans, officials confirming a twister tore through Jefferson Parish before passing into Eastern portions of the city, causing widespread damage. It’s the second tornado to hit New Orleans area today, with Saint Charles Parish taking a direct hit. At least one person was killed there. The storm’s part of a monster winter system causing chaos from the South to the North where blizzard conditions have shut down major highways. Further West in Louisiana, several houses and a medical center were damaged as the suspected twister roared through New Iberia. The storm turned deadly overnight, after an EF-2 tornado tore through the small town of Keithville, killing a young boy and his mother, his body found a half mile from demolished home. While in Farmerville, houses were blown off their foundation now after a late-night twister struck with little warning. More than twenty people were injured, cars were flipped, and belongings scattered about. Today, the McMichael picked through what was left to their home, pulling out family treasures and Christmas decorations.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 12.13.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.13.22/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Dec 2022 19:56:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.13.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;President B today signed a landmark law protecting same-sex and interracial marriage. And there are big developments in Ukraine with the US planning to send a major weapon system to the country. But first, that dangerous storm is now battering the central US from the Canadian border to the Gulf coast states. We don’t generally see an outbreak of tornadoes this late in the year but at least nine twisters ripped across Oklahoma and Texas today. In the coming days, the threat pushes East, possibly well into Florida. Further North tonight, a major storm is on unleashing blinding snow from the Rockies, across the northern plains into the Great Lakes region as it barrels towards the Midwest and Northeast. Since Monday, the storm has costed more than ten thousand flights to be delayed or canceled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tornado watch here in Northwest Louisiana will remain in effect for the next few hours. But there is great concern that tornadoes will likely strike overnight while people are sleeping. Storms tore across the South today, spawning at least six tornadoes in Texas. Along with drenching rain and hail. Sirens blared in Fort Worth as the tornado touched down in nearby Grapevine. At least five people were injured and several businesses damaged, including a carwash where a wall collapsed and a local Sam’s Club where a roof was partially ripped off. The strong winds also brought down powerlines and sent debris flying. Northwest in Dallas, in Decatur, two people were injured as the tornado rolled through early this morning. At least three tornadoes struck Oklahoma, including an EF-2 that touched down in the small town of Wayne causing major damage and leaving the entire town without power. Back in Texas, surprised passengers at DFW airport were urged to seek shelter as the weather briefly ground flights to a halt.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 12.12.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.12.22/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Dec 2022 20:27:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.12.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The first court appearance for the Lockerbie bombing suspect just wrapped, and we’re now learning whether or not US prosecutors will seek the death penalty. And there are new details as B.G recovered from her nearly ten months detention in Russia. But first, a monster winter system is dumping snow from coast to coast and bringing dangerous weather along with it. California’s Sierra Nevada got buried over the weekend with wind gusts as powerful as a Category 5 hurricane. The northeast is cleaning up from a different storm that dumped more than nine inches in parts of Massachusetts and led to the delays and cancelations of thousands of flights. But tonight, blizzard warnings posted in five states and sixty-four million Americans are facing weather alerts and advisories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight, a winter wonderland in northern California, the result of a massive storm that blanket parts of the Sierra Nevada with nearly six feet of snow. Powerful winds also wreaking havoc, gusts blew up to one hundred miles per hour, forcing this Tahoe resort to shut down the chairlifts. Major roads were also closed due to heavy snow fall and white out conditions. In South Lake Tahoe, falling trees snapped powerlines, leaving thousands without electricity. The fire department received more than two hundred emergency calls over the weekend with just ten firefighters on the force. In southern California, there are fears of more landslides like this after dramatic downpours saturated hillsides and flooded rivers led to a swift water rescue. In north Utah, more than twenty people were injured after a charter bus driver lost control and crashed on a slick highway. And as the storm moved east, time-lapse video from the National Weather shows Ketchum, Idaho, getting more than twenty inches in about twenty-four hours. And it brought thunderstorms to Iowa. But it’s not all bad, the winter weather also means some fun, the year’s first snowball fights and sledding.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 12.11.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.11.22/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Dec 2022 19:54:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.11.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin with a major break in one of the deadliest international terrorism. Tonight, a former Libyan intelligence officer accused of making the bomb that brought down Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland is now in American custody. It happened December 21st, 1988. The jumbo jet was flying from London to New York. Two hundred and fifty-nine people were on board and eleven on the ground were killed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that the suspected bomb maker is now in US custody makes a major milestone in prosecution that has been going on for decades. This was the aftermath of the bomb stashed in the luggage compartment of Pan Am flight 103, four days before Christmas. Among the victims, thirty-five students from Syracuse University returning home after semester abroad. Two years ago, the Justice Department brought charges against the man they say built the bomb, A.A.M, a Libyan national. Last month, he was reportedly detained in Libya leading to speculation he would be handed over to US authorities to stand trial. Now the Justice Department says he is in US custody. The 1988 bombing was the deadliest mass murder in British legal history bringing the threat of international terrorism to the global consciousness. Attempts to prosecute those responsible for the attack has been a decades long multi-national battle. One other man, an alleged Libyan intelligence officer was convicted for his involvement in the bombing. He maintained his innocence until his death in 2012. The suspect is expected to appear in US District Court here in DC as soon as tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 12.10.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.10.22/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Dec 2022 21:12:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.10.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, a huge storm system is set to sweep across the country starting this weekend. And it is packing a punch. Winter storm warnings have been issued across much of the west. For some, it’s snow, in some places measured in feet. For others, high winds and rain. This is Mammoth Ski Resort today in California’s Sierra in Nevada where skiers had a hard time seeing anything. Dr. G.P of our partners at the Weather Channel has the forecast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a big-time system coming for many of us across the country this coming week. Let’s start with Tuesday and that threat for severe weather which does include parts of Texas, Louisiana and Arkansas. It’s not just going to be there, though. The whole system is going to gradually move east into Wednesday as well. And I think it’s going to be that overnight threat in between. So be very careful. We could see tornadoes as well across the southern US. Here is how it’s going to evolve, we think, during the day on Tuesday. Basically, really bad weather, moving across the south, and also, a blizzard in Northern Plains at the same time, how about that? Only the way December can provide. And then, of course, through Tuesday into Wednesday the rain moves into the Southeast. We lose the severe weather threat by then, but after all, this is going to be a very impactful system coast to coast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tributes have been pouring in today for pioneering soccer journalist G.W. W who was forty-nine died Friday while covering the World Cup in Qatar. He had chronicled the sport for more than two decades, including right here at CBS.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 12.09.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.09.22/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Dec 2022 18:53:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.09.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, as we come on the air, we are monitoring a major coast to coast weather system set to bring snow over the weekend. And in just a moment we will have our CBSN investigation looking into at a growing number of kids in schools, some as young as five are being hold away in handcuffs. But first, B.G is back in United States one day after being released from a penal colony in Russia. The WNBA star and two-time Olympic gold medalist touched down this morning at San Antonio, Texas where she was reunited with her wife. The nearly ten months orbit deal ended with the one for one prisoner swap for notorious Russian arms dealer V.B. Russian President V.P saying today that future trades are possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;US officials who traveled with B.G said she appears to be in good health on the flight describing her as gracious and happy as for P suggested even more Americans could come home, the White House is treating those words with more caution than optimism. After a gruelling stint in Russian prison, Doctors are evaluating G at Brooke Army Medical Center at San Antonio. She landed in Texas this morning. For the first time, a glimpse into G’s life behind bar doing hard labor and sleeping in a bed far too tiny for a six-foot nine frame. G’s lawyer told ESPN that she chopped off her signature dreads because it was so frigid her hair froze. Marine veteran P.W in prison in Russia since 2018 on what the US called sham espionage charges was not part of the exchange which freed convicted arms dealer V.B known as the merchant of death. Today, V.P did not rule out more prisoner swaps saying anything is possible. An US official tells CBSN that over the summer, Moscow proposed trading W for a Russian assassin who is serving a life sentence in Germany convicted of murder. The US has no power to release the prisoner and Berlin refused. The loudest critics of the B and G swap were Republicans who said this trade was just not fair to the US. Former National Security Advisor J.B told CBSN that former President T had the option of swaping V.B for P.W but he declined, that was before G was detained.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 12.08.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.08.22/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Dec 2022 19:45:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.08.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;First, American B.G is on her way home. She was arrested for possession of cannabis oil nearly ten months ago. Sentenced to nine years to prison and sent to a penal colony in Russia. Her release was part of prisoner swap for international arms dealer V.B. The so-called merchant of death was serving a twenty-five years federal prison sentence in Illinois for conspiring to kill Americans and for supporting terrorism. Left out of deal, ex-Marine P.W imprisoned in Russia since 2018 on espionage charges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These final details came together within just past four eight hours. US officials fear it could all fall apart and it wasn’t until very early this morning that officials here in Washington breathe a sigh of relief when B.G finally boarded a US plane. Gathered in the oval office, President B and B.G’s wife S spoke by phone with the Thirty-two years old basketball star once she had been handed over. Russian state media shows video of the swap on the tarmac at Al Bateen Airport in Abu Dhabi. G and convicted arms dealer V.B walked towards each other and then headed to separated plane home. In Russian video filmed days earlier. G is seen signing what appears to be release forms. President B agreed last week last week to free B in order to bring G home. It follows months of public pressure from G’s fellow athletes and quiet contact between the CIA and Russia intelligence, who exchange messages between V.P’s Kremlin and Mr. B. Throughout the summer, B administration had tried to bring home both G and fifty-two-year-old P.W, a private corporate security contractor who had been imprisoned for four years on espionage charges, but Russia refused. P.W was also left behind in April when the B administration negotiated the release of marine veteran T.R. Today, a devastated W spoke by phone from a Russian penal colony. Meanwhile, G is enroute to Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio where she will get evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 12.07.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.07.22/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Dec 2022 18:37:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.07.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, CBSN has learned that new threats of a copycat attack on American infrastructure like the one that knocked out power to thousands in North Carolina. And we are just getting new information from police in that case of the four college students who were murdered. Investigators are now look into information about a specific kind of car. We do want to begin with new classified document. Lawyers for D.T say they discovered material while searching a storage unit in West Palm Beach, Florida. The items were reportedly found among the mix of boxes, gifts, suits and clothes including swords and wrestling belts. This is raising questions about what is means for the ongoing special counsel investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four months after the FBI seized records marked classified from Mar-a-Lago, still more documents marked classified are surfacing. This time, at a storage unit used by the former President in Florida. An US official confirmed to CBSN representatives of former President D.T alerted the FBI they recovered yet another set of potentially sensitive document this time at a storage facility in West Palm Beach. The officials confirmed inside a sealed box, there were two documents with classified markings adding to more than three hundred sensitive documents found this year. This revelation is the first indication classified materials might have been held or might steal beyond sight at other T’s properties. The search has reportedly conducted around Thanksgiving at three other locations, the president’s golf club, T Tower in New York and storage facility at T’s Mar-a-Lago estate. The FBI seized thirty-three boxes of records on August 8th in Mar-a-Lago including records that were supposed to be in hands of National Archives. Last month, the Justice Department appointed Special Counsel J.S to oversee the growing probe to those documents. T has downplayed the importance of procedure but critics say mishandling of these records could have allowed highly sensitive material falling to the wrong hands. Last week, appeal court overruled T’s request for independent special master to review some of the papers seized from Mar-a-Lago which had slowed the investigation though T could still appeal that decision. The investigation into him grows in accelerates.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 12.06.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.06.22/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Dec 2022 18:20:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.06.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Polls are now closed in Georgia, and it appears Georgians are on track to turn out at a record rate for the state’s Senate runoff. Plus, hospitals nationwide are running out of beds as they see raise in case of the flu, RSV and Covid. We will get those stories in just a moment. But we do want to with that major verdict involving the T organization. The former President’s realistic company was convicted on all counts. New York City’s prosecutors saying the family businesses ran a culture of fraud and deception. The T organization doling out luxury perks to executives like fancy cars and apartments and none of which they paid taxes on. It’s not the only legal issue facing D.T. The special counsel overseeing investigations into him has just getting started. We learned today of the first subpoenas linked to the effort to overturn the 2020 election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As one investigation involving former President T expands here in Washington with those new subpoenas, another into the T organization reaches its conclusion in New York. The verdict from the jury in Manhattan was overwhelming on just the second day of deliberations. The former president’s company convicted on seventeen counts including conspiracy, tax fraud and falsifying business records, all part of a fifteen-year long criminal scheme in which executives were given off the book perks including luxury cars, rent-free apartments and private school tuition for relatives. Prosecutors built the case around star witness and longtime T organization finance chief A.W who acknowledge personal greed drove the scheme. T himself was not charged in the case but prosecutors argued in court he knew about the fraud. His company now faces up to 1.6 million dollars in fines. Meanwhile, another probe into T is expanding. CBSN has confirmed newly appointed special counsel J.S sent subpoenas to local election officials in Arizona, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania seeking their communications with former President T and his allies as they attempt to overturn the 2020 election results. This comes as the House January 6 select committee is zeroing in on T and his inner circle with the chairman telling reporters the panel expects to recommend criminal charges.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 12.05.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.05.22/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Dec 2022 18:26:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.05.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We are following a number of new developing stories including the final push for votes at high stakes Georgia Senate run off. Plus, the shocking story of a young girl adopted from her own front yard. But we do want to begin with the state of emergency in North Carolina where tens of thousands are still without power and schools will be canceled for a second day after multiple power stations came under attack. Officials say a person or group were prepared intentionally targeted the grid with gunfire. And the FBI is involved in the investigation with the power company warns it could take days before electricity is fully restored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The community is wondering who is behind this attack. The utility company here may need until Thursday to get electricity flowing again. Criminal and targeted, an attack at the heart of North Carolina, someone shot at two power substations. Gunfire that wrecked major utility equipment pushing more counties into crisis. Who and why is unclear, but the impact was obvious. Like these traffic lights, all across North Carolina, has no power. Back in January, CBSN obtained a bulletin from the Department of Homeland Security warning that domestic violent extremists continue to plot credible, specific plans to attack, electricity infrastructure. The US has roughly fifty-five thousand substations. Earlier this year, Sixty Minutes profiled how lightly protected and vulnerable they often are. Turns out, taking out fewer than twenty critical substations all at once could blackout the entire country, the way Moore County looks today. For now, this attack has not considered domestic terrorism but people here are unnerved and with no power, schools have been canceled and a curfew will be in effect again tonight.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 12.04.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.04.22/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Dec 2022 20:49:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.04.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The state of Georgia is once again at the center of a pivotal battle in American politics. It’s where the last undecided Senate race of the Midterm Elections will be determined. In a runoff between Democrat R.W and Republican challenger H.W. Right now, more than 1.8 million ballots have already been casted in early voting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This runoff won’t change the balance of the power in the Senate, but it will decide which party has greater influence in the chamber as Senator W and H.W are both making their closing cases to voters about why they deserve the job. After clinching the SEC championship this weekend, legendary Georgia running back H.W is hoping to follow the Bulldog’s win over LSU with a victory of his own Tuesday. Georgia wins by twenty points. But it’s unlikely Tuesday’s Senate election margin will be any where near that. Either candidate made the required fifty percent threshold on November 8, forcing the race into overtime. Since then, the state has been bombarded with ads, campaign volunteers and out of town visitors. The current president and his predecessor stayed away during the runoff. But one president who did return to Georgia, B.O as both candidates have faced questions about their past. Most recently, the Republican challenger has been hit with new allegations of domestic abuse to revelations of tax records indicating his primary home is in Texas, not Georgia.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 12.03.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.03.22/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Dec 2022 20:09:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.03.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;It is not winter yet, but sure looks like it across parts of the west this weekend. For millions, it’s round two of storms. This is Seattle tonight. Snow flurries are making roadways slick and travel potentially treacherous. More snow and lots of rain are forecast. This on the heels of another potent storm that sweeping the east. Today, whiteout conditions in Loveland, Colorado as a powerful storm swept the state making driving dangerous. The snow with high winds forced some roads to shut down. Those gusts also triggering massive dust clouds and blew tumbleweeds across streets. Outside Portland, Oregon, this highway was closed after rain sent mud and rock onto the pavement. The debris filling at least ten big rigs. The roadways remain closed tonight. As this storm blows out of the Pacific Northwest, a second blast of snow, rain and wind is moving in. The snow piling up in the Sierra Nevada, twenty-four inches of snow Thursday alone. The cold front is sweeping east, expected to drop temperatures to the Atlantic coast. It is sunny in Los Angeles now, but rain is expected tomorrow. That fresh Sierra snow will help replenish California’s reservoirs when it melts. A much-needed step to help battle the drought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We turn now to the critical runoff race for the Senate in Georgia. Incumbent Democrat R.W and Republican H.W are making their final pitches to voters this weekend ahead of Tuesday’s vote.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 12.02.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.02.22/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Dec 2022 18:54:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.02.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, we have a number of stories that we’ve following including President B’s meeting with Prince W in B and US men soccer’s captain C.P getting the all clear ahead of tomorrow big match at the World Cup. But we want to begin with that new data tonight about job numbers. It is strong, but fears about inflation and possible recession remain. The Labor Department’s November report out today showed employment increased by two hundred and sixty-three thousand jobs. On Wall Street, the DOW fell by more than three hundred points in early trading but rallied late the day and closed in positive territory. The S&amp;amp;P 500 and NASDAQ finished slightly lower. President B signed a bill that blocks potential nationwide railroad strike and prevents what he called an economic catastrophe during the holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mixed signals tonight as President B tries to keep the economy on the rails. But during this holiday season, there is still concerns over high inflation and a possible recession. The deal to avert a rail strike coincide with the holiday surprise a better expected job’s report. Employers’ defiant high inflation and interest rate hikes, adding tens of thousands of jobs more than predicted. The unemployment rates hold in steady. Hospitality and leisure led the games. Healthcare and government jobs also saw strong growth. But there are signs of weakness, retail jobs fell despite strong holiday sales. On media, techs continue to shed jobs. CNN and Doordash are the latest companies to announce major cut this week. Another concern, wages jumped more than expected, leading to fears that high inflation will continue. But a gift to consumers, gas prices are down thirty-two cents last month and it could fall below $3 by Christmas, good news for holiday shoppers. The National Retail Federation estimates holiday sales will go up about eight percent this year, that slower growth compared to last year but higher historical average.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 12.01.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.01.22/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Dec 2022 20:18:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.01.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;There is new information tonight in the mysterious quadruple murder of those college students in Idaho. And we’re going to get to those middle schoolers that were taken to the hospital in a suspected mass drug overdose. But first here in Washington, lawmakers from both parties coming together tonight to avoid a railroad strike that could have devasting consequences to the US economy. Tonight, the bipartisan bill is awaiting President B’s signature. The legislation will raise wages but the agreement stops short of giving employees seven days of paid sick leave. The move comes amid some good economic news today, the Commerce Department reporting a key inflation rate slowed more than expected. And gas prices keep on falling. A tank of gas is at its lowest since February with Americans paying on average $3.47 per gallon. And GasBuddy is predicting prices could dip below $3 by Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an economic crisis avoided in the 11th hour. Congress averted the strike late today, but not everyone’s pleased Congress intervened at all or with the end result. One week and one day before the deadline, Congress ordered warded off a gut punch to the US economy. The deal prevents a walk off by one hundred and fifteen thousand railway workers that could have costed the economy two billion dollars a day, snarled holiday shipping traffic and spiking inflation further. President B who had built a record supporting labor union defied some of them by asking Congress to intervene. The deal gives rail workers a twenty four percent raise and five thousand dollars in bonuses for five years but not seven days of paid sick leave which unions had been fighting. President B says he&amp;rsquo;ll sign the bill as soon as it reaches his desk. Acknowledging labor unions aren’t happy about this he says Washington has averted what he called, a Christmas catastrophe.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 11.30.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.30.22/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Dec 2022 18:27:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.30.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, residents across the south are picking up the pieces after a line of deadly storms swept across three states. A mother and son died in their home when a tree fell overnight. The damage is devastating. Homes and buildings were left in ruins. Entire neighborhoods have been leveled with buildings ripped from their foundations and trees toppled by the high winds. Heavy machineries have been brought to clear the debris, and power is still out to thousands of customers. There were reports of two dozen tornadoes throughout Alabama, Louisianan and Mississippi. So far, at least seven have been confirmed. And in Alabama, the Montgomery County sheriff officer described the damage in the flat wood community has total destruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National Weather Service says it was a category EF-2 tornado with winds about a hundred fifteen miles per hour that struck this neighborhood. You can see what it did to this community center, it is destroyed. This is also where a woman and her eight-year-old son were killed in the storm. Daylight brought a harsh reality across the southeast. As overnight storms in multiple states spawned damaging tornadoes and torrential rains. Mississippi and Alabama took the brunt with a small community of flat wood, just north Montgomery, Alabama, taking a direct hit. This is where two people were killed when a tree fell on their home just after 3AM in total darkness. In hard hit Lowndes County, Mississippi, a twister turned homes into piles of debris. And left local fire station beyond repair. The National Weather Service said the damage roots blown away, toppled trees and metal bent in half is consistent with an at least EF-2 tornado. While in Eutaw, Alabama, the roof at this apartment was ripped off. And the oak tree fell through this church, no one was injured. Severe weather systems like this are coming more common during winter months. Possibly, according to the National Weather Service, because of more moisture from a warming Gulf of Mexico. Deputies say they have conducted a search of other homes in this affected area, and everyone is accounted for.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 11.29.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.29.22/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Nov 2022 19:51:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.29.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;There is breaking news out of the south where we’ve learned several tornadoes have touched down and nearly twenty million Americans remain in the path of severe weather. Plus, tonight, after that major victory for the US men’s soccer team. We are getting new details of conditions of star player C.P, who was taken to the hospital after the game. We’ll have more on that in just a moment. But first we want to begin with that breaking news right here in Washington. A federal jury found Oath Keepers founder S.R guilty of seditious conspiracy. R was convicted for his part in the violent January 6th assault on the Capitol and his failed plot to overturn the 2020 election. K.M, another member of far-right group was also found guilty of seditious conspiracy. Three other co-defendants were acquitted of seditious conspiracy but found guilty of other crimes related the attack on the Capitol. R and M face up to twenty years in prison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a marathon of two-month trial, ended with three days of jury deliberations and the jury convicting the highest profile of nine hundred Capitol riot defendants so far. Late today, the jury delivered the stunning verdict, finding S.R, the founder of the far-right Oath Keepers, and his co-defendant, K.M in Florida, guilty of the rare charge of seditious conspiracy, plotting to block the peaceful transfer of power in Jan.6th, each now facing up to twenty years in prison on the seditious conspiracy charge alone. During two months testimony and presentations, prosecutors show messages and images of the group hatching a plan to equip themselves with tactical gear to stage guns outside the Washington DC city limits to mobilize if then President T invoked the Insurrection Act. In one message displayed at trial, R said shortly after 2020 election, “We aren’t getting through this without a fight”. The Justice Department also argued that five defendants helped arrange a military stack formation to breach the Capitol amid the mob. R, the highest profile figure to face trial in connection with the attack, took stand in his own defense at trial, where he continued to argue the 2020 election was unconstitutional and that the group was equipped only to protect themselves against left-wing agitators. The other three defendants were found not guilty on the seditious conspiracy charge but were convicted of other federal counts including obstructing an official proceeding.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 11.28.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.28.22/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Nov 2022 18:04:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.28.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Millions in the south are facing severe weather threat of tornados. And in Texas tonight, more than two million people are without safe drinking water. We are just getting news that schools will be canceled again tomorrow. But first Wall Street today suffering a major sell off, extraordinary protest and outrage are spreading across C over X Covid lockdown polices. As the world grows more concerned about recession and since China is world’s number one manufacture, production fears caused the DOW to fall 1.4%. NASDAQ and S&amp;amp;P 500 both fell more than 1.5%. Apple share dropped following reports that production at the world’s largest iPhone factory has been impacted by the unrest. The White House says the President B is monitoring a large C protest in decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight, the most widespread C protest in years. At least ten cities include S have now spread to HK. And the unrest is affecting global markets. Shares of Apple fell nearly 3% for reports that company could see production losses at Foxconn in eastern C for workers to protest Covid restrictions and the lack of bonus payments. This is by far the biggest challenge yet X zero Covid policy which is battered C economy and lock down hundreds of millions of people in their homes. Crowds have faced off with the police and there have been unknown numbers of arrests including a BBC journalist who was later released. Public outrage was originally sparked last week by a tragedy in western C when ten people burned to death in the apartment fire. And angry crowd gathered around at local government offices convinced that Covid restrictions have stopped fire engines from reaching the flames. Authorities denied that. On Monday, C police patrolled what had been the trouble spots. In a statement, the White House criticized C zero Covid policy. President B has been briefed on the protest, but hasn’t spoken publicly about them.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 11.27.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.27.22/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Nov 2022 19:34:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.27.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Roughly fifty-five million traveled this holiday weekend. And today is expected to be one of the busiest travel days of the year. Air travel reached pre-pandemic levels again on Saturday alone, the TSA screened more than 2.2 million people. You can see FlightAware shows this misery map showing trouble spots in red. So far, there have been more than one hundred cancelations and at least forty-two hundred delays across the country. For those of you behind the wheel right now, you are probably taking it slow. Some wet roads there that we saw earlier in DC today. But we want to start off in New York.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With record number of travelers and nasty weather along the east coast, New York’s LaGuardia is one of several airports warning passengers to get to the airport early today. Most Americans traveled by car Sunday. In the Northeast, drivers were forced to dodge rain as they returned home. AAA says this year was the third busiest ever for Thanksgiving travel. And now, AAA is anticipating an explosion of what it’s calling revenge travel. While many people are returning home today, travel has changed since the pandemic. And AAA expects more people to continue returning home today and throughout the week. Rain and snow in some parts of the country are expected to cause slick travel for millions of you heading back home.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 11.26.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.26.22/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Nov 2022 20:23:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.26.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;It is one of the biggest shopping weekends of the year and Americans are spending and it’s 2019. With Covid fears subsiding, Black Friday shoppers turned out in force, taking advantage of the sales despite inflation in forty years high. One thing that is keeping in store crowd levels low, online shopping. More than nine million dollars was spent home on Friday. That’s a record, up more than two percent from last year. And on what is now known as Small Business Saturday, one survey found more than sixty percent of small retailers are expecting higher profits this holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new survey from personal finance website bankrate.com shows even more Americans shop on Saturday than Black Friday. But the majority of consumers still buy from large businesses. But the retailers say the cloud hanging over this weekend, is inflation. Now Small Business Saturday is relatively new idea. It’s only been around since 2010. But lasty year, Americans spent an estimated twenty-three billion dollars on small businesses, with more than half of that spent online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s beginning to look a lot like winter, snow blanketed Western Texas again today. But what’s in store for the millions of you heading home tomorrow or Monday?&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 11.25.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.25.22/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Nov 2022 18:27:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.25.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, there are disturbing new details about the gunman and his possible motive for Tuesday night shooting rampages inside a Walmart in Chesapeake, Virginia. Police released a message titled death note found on thirty-one-year-old A.B’s cellphone, in which he complained about being harassed and wrote he was tormented by his coworkers. Authorities say B legally purchased a nine-millimeter handgun used in the attack just hours before killing six and injuring seven others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, as the police investigation continues now it gives us some senses for a possible motivation for the shooting. The community is continuing to come together planning a city-wide vigil for the lives lost on Monday. Police released the suicide note found on shooter’s phone. Thirty-one-year-old A.B asked for god’s forgiveness, railed against his coworkers who he said spoke badly of him and seems blame the shooting on the believe his phone was recently hacked. Investigators say the shooter has no criminal history and the nine-millimeter handgun he used was legally purchased just hours before he gunned down his coworkers. While he passed background check to buy the firearm, Virginia is not among the nine states in the District of Columbia with a waiting period after the purchase of a gun. In exit polls taken during the Midterm Elections earlier this month, fifty-six percent of voters said they support a stricter gun control measure. Currently gun laws in the US varies state by state. California for example has a ten-day waiting period for somebody after they buy a gun. In 2016, CBSN was able to legally buy a firearm in Virginia and leave with it for about thirty-eight minutes.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 11.24.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.24.22/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Nov 2022 17:25:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.24.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;On this Thanksgiving Day, the community in Chesapeake, Virginia is still grappling with the loss of six lives inside a Walmart Tuesday night. And we’re also learning new details tonight about the possible motive of the thirty-one-year-old gunman. We now know more about the victims and the jobs they held. The age ranges from sixteen to seventy and include an overnight shelf stocker and a custodian. After the shooting, President B said because of yet another horrific and senseless act of violence, there are now even more tables around this country that will have empty seats this Thanksgiving. This morning, he called on Congress to try to do something to save lives and again called for a ban on assault weapons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this Thanksgiving, investigators’ working on that mass shooting did not stop. They are digging in the gunman’s past but his final week on the job may offer a clear picture yet. The search for answers in the mass shooting in Chesapeake, Virginia continued as investigators come through evidence at the Walmart and the home of A.B. Police say thirty-one-year-old, a store manager, opened fire in the Walmart, killing six and injuring seven before turning the gun on himself. Multiple media reports say his phone contains notes complaining at his job and harassment from his coworkers. All of the dead were store employees. Police have not named the sixteen-year-old victim as he is a minor. In Colorado Springs still reeling from mass shooting at a gay nightclub there last week. A local church is stepped up to host a meal for those who would normally gather at Club Q on Thanksgiving. That mass shooting bringing the Colorado Springs community together this Thanksgiving Day and we are seeing a similar response in Chesapeake, Virginia. Tonight, residents are being advised to take care of their mental health while also supporting the victims and their families.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 11.23.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.23.22/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Nov 2022 19:49:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.23.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with yet another mass shooting in this country. The latest took place inside a Walmart and Chesapeake, Virginia when a manager opened fire at his fellow employees. Six people were killed including a sixteen-year-old boy, seven others were injured. Police identified the gunman as thirty-one-year-old A.B. He was armed with a handgun and multiple magazines. Authorities say it appears he died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Right now, there is no clear motive. This is the fifty-sixth mass shooting in the last month according to the gun violence archive. In a statement today, President B called it yet another horrific and senseless act of violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty-four hours ago, holiday shopping turned into horror when that store employee turned that gun on his coworkers and customers. Tonight, investigators want to know why. The first 911 call came in at 10:12 last night. Police say the first officer on scene entered the store four minutes later. The alleged gunman, thirty-one-year-old Walmart employee A.B was armed with a pistol. And investigators say he had additional rounds of ammunition. Investigators say B died after a self-inflicted gunshot wound. But not before shooting and injuring seven people and killing six. Some of the victims were found in the Walmart break room. The investigation will stretch through Thanksgiving holiday. Authorities are still working to determine a motive.

Tonight, we are hearing from people who were inside the club when the gunman opened fire, killing five and injuring eighteen others. For the first time, a retired army major, R.F is speaking out. He has been held as a hero after tackling the gunman and holding him until the police arrive. President B called F to thank him for his brave and his instinct to act. F wasn’t the only hero. Another patriot kicked the gunman in the head. We’re learning more about the condition about the suspect, A.L. The twenty-two-year-old was allegedly not cooperating with police.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five lives loss but tonight, so many more saved thanks to that army veteran who told us his story. How it was simply instinct for him to put himself in harm’s way for the safety of others. R.F never expected a warzone would following home. The army veteran awarded bronze stars was at Club Q with his wife, daughter and her boyfriend when the gunman started firing. F says he grab the suspect by his body armor and throw to the ground. It was too late to save his daughter’s boyfriend R.G, among the five people who died. As the community comes in terms of the tragedy, new details on twenty-two-year-old suspect A.L. Authorities say tonight, he is out of the hospital and in the county jail. He was known as N.B until age fifteen he changed his name. Washington Post reports the action came after he’d been viciously bullied online. A was arrested for alleged bomb threat last year but never prosecute. Two days from Thanksgiving, there is profound sadness in Colorado Springs. The time for families to come together for Thanksgiving, many here torn apart. The suspect in this case will make his first appearance tomorrow morning.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 11.21.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.21.22/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Nov 2022 20:41:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.21.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, we are learning new details about the latest mass shooting in America, this time, in Colorado Springs at a gay nightclub at Saturday night. Five are dead, seventeen more were shot and even more injured when they ran for their lives. The twenty-two suspect is in the hospital, facing murder and hate crime charges. And tonight, police are hailing two heroes, T.J and R.F who saved countless lives by disarming the gunman before officers arrived on the scene. F served fifteen years in the army, including four tours in Afghanistan and Iraq. And he told the New York Times that he went into combat mode and allegedly grabbed a pistol from the gunman and hit him on the head quote “over and over”. This bar was considered a safe space for the LGBTQ community. The mayor of Colorado Springs tonight tells CBSN that the shooting certainly has the trappings of a hate crime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight, we have new information about the shooting spree here at Club Q, where people are gathering to pay tribute. We’re also learning more about those who died. They are two employees, three customers ambushed during a night out. The suspect, twenty-two-year-old A.L will face murder and hate crime charges. Investigators say they will file formal charges soon. A man of the same name and age was arrested after a bomb threat near Colorado Springs last year, but the charges were dismissed. This is doorbell video of the man surrendering to police. There is no record police or family members tried to trigger Colorado red flag law. That would have allowed police to seized any weapons the man may have. The call came in later Saturday night. A shooter, fired at the crowd. Now identifying the two heroes who stopped the suspect, R.F and T.J. The shooting comes amid a number of anti-LGBTQ bills, targeting transgender people for discrimination. Today, US Transportation Secretary P.B, the administration highest ranking openly gay man, told CBSN he believes political rhetoric is providing fuels for violence. For now, Club Q is closed indefinitely. When or if it reopens, the memories will simply too much. Authorities have now revised downward the number of people hurt to eighteen, seventeen of them were shot and a number of those are still in the hospital in a community shaken to its core.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 11.20.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.20.22/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Nov 2022 19:45:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.20.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Police in Colorado Springs are praising the actions of at least two patrons at an LGBTQ night club as, quote “heroic”. Last night, they confronted and fought with the gunman who entered the building and begin firing. Before the violence came to an end, at least five people were killed, twenty-five others were wounded. Police have identified the suspect as a twenty-two-year-old man who is now in custody. Today, President B said in a statement quote “Places that are supposed to be safe spaces of acceptance and celebration should never be turned into places of terror and violence”. Mr. B adding “We cannot and must not tolerate hate”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a community in shock tonight, Club Q has long been a safe haven for members of LGBTQ community to gather. That sense of security now shattered as the FBI and others investigate whether this was a crime motivated by hate. Witnesses described a scene of sheer terror inside Club Q late Saturday night. The bartender saw unimaginable horror all around him. Police said the shooter came just before midnight with two guns and opened fire. M.H is one of the club’s owners and raced to the scene of tragedy. On Facebook, the club posting “the tragedy could have been worse without the help of heroic customers who stopped the gunman”. Detectives say the gunman is twenty-two-year-old A.L. Tonight, he is in custody and investigators are looking into whether he has a record. Officials say it’s too early to say whether it was a hate crime targeting members of the LGBTQ community. The shooting comes more than six years after the attack at LGBTQ Pulse Nightclub in Orlando, which killed forty-nine people. The nation’s second deadliest mass shooting.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 11.19.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.19.22/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Nov 2022 19:14:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.19.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The snow keeps piling up in western of New York, following a historic and life-threatening storm. But we begin in Raleigh, North Carolina. Today, it was the city’s Christmas parade, where during the celebration disaster struck. A driver pulling a parade flow lost control, crushing into a dance crew killing one child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A runaway truck turned a Christmas parade in Raleigh, North Carolina into a horrific scene. It started when this pickup truck, pulling a parade float lost control. First, it slowly pushes through the crowd, some performers scattered. But there is confusion, many don’t realize what’s happening. Then the truck picks up speed and strikes a young girl killing her. Bystanders and police officers jumped into action, chasing after the truck and physically forcing it to stop. Witnesses say they thought it was an accident. The driver was honking to warn others that the truck was out of control. Police say the driver is cooperating and facing multiple charges including misdemeanor death by motor vehicle and reckless driving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To New York state now where at least two people are dead following a historic storm. Snow fall totals are staggering. More than six feet and counting in Buffalo. The deep freeze being felt across a wide swath of the country. This is the Bill Stadium Orchard Park.

Attorney General M.G today appointed a special counsel to take the lead. J.S has a long history with Department of Justice and is the former chief prosecutor for the special court in The Hague, which investigates and prosecutes war crimes. He will now oversee the probe into the January 6th insurrection and T’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election as well as the investigation in the former President&amp;rsquo;s handling classified documents found at Mar-A-Lago. The appointment comes just three days after T announced his 2024 candidacy for the White House. In this afternoon, the former president slammed appointment, calling it political and a disgrace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was not a last-minute decision. Privately, DOJ officials have been discussing this idea of appointing special counsel for weeks now. And this likely speeds up investigations swirling around D.T. Attorney General M.G said today that given former President T’s decision to run again, it was in the public interest to appoint a special counsel. Tapped for the job J.S, a war crimes prosecutor and former head of Justice Department&amp;rsquo;s Public Integrity section. He will now decide whether Mr. T will face charges in the case in holding classified documents found in T’s Florida estate and whether he and his allies interfere with the transfer of power on January 6th. Historically, special counsel has been appointed to avoid conflict in political influence. But G’s move comes just days after T 2024 announcement, setting up a potential rematch with President B. T responded late tonight. This special counsel starts today. The investigation has been ongoing for months because the FBI and prosecutors have been on the case. Meanwhile, the White House tells CBSN, it was not giving a heads up about this announcement.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 11.17.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.17.22/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Nov 2022 18:20:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.17.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Well tonight, the political landscape here in Washington is on the verge of big change. House Speaker N.P is stepping down the leadership after historic twenty years. The longest serving democratic leader in the house. P became the first woman to wield the speaker’s gavel back in 2007. First elected in congress in 1987 she’s been a trailblazer, but also a lightning rod for Republican critics. And the announcement comes after her husband’s being brutally attacked last month when she is allegedly the intended target. There is bipartisan agreement about her legacy too. President B called P the most consequential speaker in the history even former Republican Speaker N.G said we can argue she’s been the strongest speaker in history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaker P said she will continue representing San Francisco in Congress next year but for the first time in two decades, she will not be a party leader. It’s a historic announcement but also one with profound immediate impact here. With Republicans set to take control of US House in January, N.P, the outsize political force for a generation said it’s the time for her to step back. The announcement comes just weeks of violent attack against her eighty-two-year-old husband, P.P, in San Francisco, allegedly by a conspiracy theorist who was targeting her. The current democratic leadership all in their eighties are now making room for new generation leaders, potentially including H.G in New York City who would become the first African American party leader in congressional history. He will have to content with Republican majority which plans to aggressively investigate the B administration, including what they see as a politicized Justice Department, as well as the president’s family. The first ever female speaker elected twice is a prolific fundraiser and vote counter having steer passage then President O’s Affordable Care Act and key parts of the B Agenda.

The sheriff office says the most serious injuries include head trauma, broken bones and lost limbs. The driver was taken into custody at the scene by other members of the training academy. But officials say it appears to have been a horrific accident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firefighters at the station behind us were about to go off shift when they heard the collision and rushed out onto the scene to begin administering aid, something the sheriff says saved lives. In early morning training run turned into a real-life emergency after a car drove head-on into more than two dozen law enforcement recruits on a suburban street outside Los Angeles. Some of the cadets told investigators the car accelerated to thirty or forty miles per hour before hitting them, leaving little time to get out the way. Police identified the driver as a twenty-two-year-old man who they say was detained at the scene and passed a breathalyzer test. Seriously injured cadets were airlifted twenty miles to the nearest trauma center. Loved ones rushed to the hospital. The incident occurred just down the block from an elementary school, classes today were canceled. Just before we came on the air, police towed away the suspect’s SUV and opened up the crime scene. Investigators say they are going to look at all possible motives from a medical emergency to whether or not this was intentional.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 11.15.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.15.22/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Nov 2022 18:47:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.15.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, what could be a major escalation in Russia’s war in Ukraine after two missiles crossed over the border to Poland, a NATO country, killing two people. Ukraine’s President Z said the world must act. The B administration says it’s working with Polish government to gather information and can’t confirm details ahead of NATO just called for an emergency meeting for tomorrow morning. Article Five of the alliance states that any attack on one member is an attack on all of its members. The only that Article Five has been evoked was in response to the 9.11 Attack on the United States. And there is this news tonight, President B is officially asking Congress for thirty-seven billion dollars in emergency aid for Ukraine. All of this comes as Russia unleashed more than ninety airstrikes primarily at Ukraine’s energy facilities causing widespread blackouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poland has put its military on heighten readiness. It’s a scenario we’ve always fears since the start of the war. What would happen if a nearby NATO ally was struck? Either by accident or otherwise. We are about to find out. Tonight, in one of Russia’s biggest missiles strikes since the start of the war. Two rockets landed outside Ukraine in the neighboring Poland, a NATO member, killing two civilians. It is unclear whether they were Russian rockets, or Ukrainian air defense missiles. The blast occurs roughly seven miles from Ukraine’s border at a grain silo in the town of Przewodow. The polish government held an emergency meeting as did other nearby NATO countries amid concerns whether this can be considered an attack triggering Article Five of the NATO charter. In Ukraine, Russia fired more than ninety missiles around the country. Most intercepted, others hitting residential buildings and plunging ten million households into darkness after the electrical grid was targeted. Four days ago, Moscow retreated from critical city of Kherson. It’s a double-edge sword as one Ukrainian mayor tells me. Russia has issued a statement denying it firing missiles near the Ukraine-Poland border and called it quote “a deliberate occasion in order to escalate the situation”.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 11.14.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.14.22/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Nov 2022 18:39:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.14.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, the president of University of Virginia says classes will be canceled for a second day tomorrow as the community searches for answers. The suspect is in custody after the deadly shooting rocked Charlottesville community. And tonight, in an interview with CBSN affiliate WTVR, the alleged gunman’s father said his son was paranoid getting picked on. Police say the shooting took place just after 10:15PM last night where a charter bus as it returned to campus from Washington DC. The three killed were all members of UVA football team. The suspect, twenty-two-year-old C.D.J is a student who was the member of the team during his freshman year in 2018. C was charged today with three counts of second-degree murder and three counts of using a handgun in a mission of felony. But police still haven’t reviewed a motive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight, students are coming to this football stadium with flowers as a makeshift memorial after a day of tears across this university campus. That emotional moment hung in the air as UVA police chief T.L confirmed suspect C.D was apprehended after more than a twelve-hour manhunt. Campus officials say, five students were shot in the end of class field trip as they returned Sunday night. The suspect’s father C.J says the last time he talked to his son; he was paranoid. What is believed to be the bus where the shooting unfolded, now a crime scene. Authorities detailed recent complaints about J: possessing a gun in September, though the weapon was not found, as well as hazing incident, but in that case, the witness did not cooperate. And authorities say the initial charges of second-degree murder will likely be upgraded as investigators discover new evidence.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 11.13.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.13.22/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Nov 2022 18:23:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.13.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin with the new follow of the Midterm Elections. After predictions of a sweep that did not materialize, Republicans face a week that could be critical deciding the future direction and leadership of the party. Set to grab the spotlight Tuesday, the former President D.T, he has been teasing months that he will run again for the White House. Tonight, ballots are still being counted in several states with some races still too close to call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter how the final number shock out on the US House and the Senate, the majorities will be slim as congressional democrats defied Midterm Elections predictions. Incumbent Senator C.C.M celebrated Sunday. CBSN projected a narrow win over her Republican challenger A.L, cementing Democratic control of the US Senate even ahead of Georgia’s December 6th runoff. CBSN estimates the US House still leans Republican. But as new members arrive for this week’s orientation, divisions within the GOP are undisplay. CBSN projects more than one hundred and fifty GOP election deniers are those who raised questions about 2020 will serve in the new House. But in a number of high-profile state races, they lost. None will serve as top election officials in battleground states. Ballots are still being counted in Arizona, the race for governor between Democratic Secretary of State K.H and T loyalist K.L still a tossup. The former president putting the party at a crossroads. CBSN has learned that the former president plans to launch his third campaign for president despite pushback within the GOP party and even some allies urging him to postponed his announcement until after the Georgia’s Senate runoff. Some Republicans are also talking about other potential names including Florida Governor R.D and Maryland Governor L.H. A moderator tells CBSN he is still considering a possible run but notes there is a battle for which direction the Republican party will go.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 11.12.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.12.22/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Nov 2022 18:21:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.12.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Ballots are still being counted in several seats following this week’s Midterm Elections leaving block buster races undecided, more on that in a moment. But first, there is breaking news in Texas today of two vintage warplanes collided in midair at least six people on board are feared dead. It happened outside Dallas at an air show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A horrific scene in the sky above Dallas after a midair collision at a Veteran’s Day air show. Crowds watching the winds over Dallas shows recorded a cell video as a WWII aero bomber is hit by another smaller plane sending both crushing down in an exploding ball of fire. The accident happened near Dallas executive airport. Debris showered down nearby highway, the FAA and NTSB are investigating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the latest now on this week’s midterms tonight, all eyes are on Nevada. The race between incumbent Senator C.C.M and Republican challenger A.L is neck and neck. Right now, this is the balance of power in the Senate after Democrats in Arizona celebrated a big win. After four excruciating days of ballots counting on uncertainty, Senator M.K today declared reelection victory. But his opponent B.M has yet to concede, tweeting today saying “voters decide, not the media; let’s count the vote”. And those votes are still being counted. Statewide, there are about three hundred and seventy thousand ballots left to process in Arizona. Republican gubernatorial candidate K.L, who is trailing Democrat K.H in a tossup race has not presented any evidence backup those allegations. In Nevada, the governor’s race was called last night for Republican J while the Senate race is still neck and neck. This as Georgia Senate race heads to a runoff. Republicans seem likely to take a small majority in the House, but across the country, many of those races are still too close to call. Now adding to this mix, former President T is teasing a big announcement next week, there’s been some debate in Republican circles about whether former president’s involvement in this race helped or hurt Republican candidates. But here in Arizona, most T supporters we spoke to said if he run again, they’ll vote for him.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 11.11.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.11.22/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Nov 2022 18:47:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.11.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, we come on the air with severe weather impacting millions of Americans post tropical cyclone N is unleashing torrential rains across the eastern half of the country. The storm which made landfall as a rare November hurricane costed unprecedented structural damage along Florida’s Atlantic coast. Heavy rains with possible floodings are tracking from the central Appalachian to New England tonight until Saturday. In Florida, residents are still picking up the pieces after dangerous storm surge washed away the foundations from several beach front homes causing them to collapse into the Atlantic Ocean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A giant hole is all that’s left where the back cap of this family’s property once stood. And families along the shore fear further collapse as erosion from hurricane N washed away sand from beneath their homes. Tonight, residents along Florida’s east coast are wondering what comes next. Near half the property that has been with the family for about forty years simply slipped to the Sea of Atlantic. Much the sand on the beaches will need to be restored likely costing to the millions. That doesn’t include rebuilding the sea walls to better protect these properties.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 11.10.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.10.22/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Nov 2022 20:55:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.10.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, tropical storm N, is making its way across the state of Florida after slamming into its state’s east coast as a category 1 hurricane overnight. The rare November hurricane is the first to make landfall along the state’s eastern coastline since C in 2005. All of Florida sixty-seven counties are under state of emergency as N move through the state before heading north later tonight. More than one hundred and sixty-three thousand homes and businesses are without power as tropical storm force winds have knocked down trees and power lines across the region. The most destructive damage came from the storm surge created by sixteen-foot waves causing devastating erosion, washing away parts of the coastline. Officials say at least four people have died including two killed by a downed power line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remnants of N are still being felt here in Daytona Beach. And just a few blocks from where I am standing, families along the East Coast are under a curfew until 7AM tomorrow. This as workers assess safety of buildings on the water. Homes of this barrier island teeter on the edge before hurricane N hit. Now, many have crumbled into the ocean. Local officials in Volusia County say as many as forty single homes and nineteen hotels are compromised. Walls are gone, furniture is ruined. Everything these homeowners have worked for has been swept away by the sea. Back in September, hurricane I undermined seawalls in the area. And there wasn’t enough time to fix them before N made a rare November landfall. Tonight, homes, roads and the beach are all in safe. And residents are urged to stay indoors. Rising water and flooded roads have cut off neighborhoods. And here in Daytona Beach shores, neighbors are overwhelmed by what it will take to rebuild the community. Across the state, more than twelve hundred flights were canceled today. Meanwhile, flights in and out of Orlando International Airport resume tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 11.09.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.09.22/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Nov 2022 18:28:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.09.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, President B is celebrating with what he called a strong night for Democrats after his party outperformed expectation in the midterms. The president says Americans sent a clear and unmistakable message last night about democracy and abortion rights. In a rare wide-ranging conference late today, President B answered questions about working with the GOP despite possibly investigations into his son H, whether he will run for reelection and even what he thinks of T showdown for the Republican nomination. At this hour, control of Congress is still up for grabs. CBSN estimates the battle for the House has leaned Republicans it could take several days before we know which party will have the majority. And it could be weeks before we know which party will control the Senate, the three states are still undecided. Plus, it’s now official that Senate race in Georgia, a hotly contested seat. Well, it is headed for a runoff, that’s in December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And upbeat President B argued that this was the best midterm showing for a first term democratic president in forty years. He called a validation of his agenda. But tonight, that agenda is still in jeopardy if Republicans do end up ??? the House or the Senate. As President B held on to hope. Republican leader K.M plowed ahead with plans for a House takeover, formally announcing his bid for Speaker. Senate control is still unclear too. Democrats picked up a seat in Pennsylvania where abortion ranked as the number one issue. It could come down to Georgia, where Republican H.W is predicting a bruising December runoff against Democrat Senator R.W. Massachusetts elected the nation first openly Lesbian governor. W.M becomes the first African American governor, elected in Maryland and just the third in US history. Voters elected the first ??? US congressman, a twenty-five-year-old in Florida. And at forty, former White House secretary H.S will become the youngest US Governor when she soared in Arkansas. The White House releases a video today of President B calling around to Democratic winners. The night did not turnout well for former President T as some of the controversial candidates he endorsed struggled, putting winnable seats at risk. But even a seat majority, the House or Senate give Republican subpoena power and they’re vowing to launch a range of probes on day one. Exit poll from yesterday’s elections suggested that two thirds of Americans voters do not think President B should run for reelection in 2024. He was asked about that today, he said that those numbers don’t bother him, he is always intended to run again but he won’t make a final decision until the new year even if his predecessor President T goes ahead with plans to announce his candidacy as soon as next week.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 11.08.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.08.22/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Nov 2022 18:32:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.08.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, after months of campaigning and billions of dollars spending, voters will finally have their voices heard in these historic elections. Polling places opened as 6AM in ten states as long lines of voters were seen from Maine to Hawaii and every battleground state in between. We’re getting new information about what was on voters’ minds as they went to the polls, inflation and abortion were the top two issues. Republicans tonight are increasingly confident that they will win control of the House and the Senate while Democrats are looking to defy history and hold on to their majorities. One race that will help determine control is Georgia’s contest between incumbent Democratic Senator R.W and Republican H.W. Exit polls show that top qualities that Georgia voters are looking for in the race are honesty and integrity and a candidate who shares their values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turnout has been robust here in Georgia and nationwide as voters face a critical choice about the direction of the country and which party will control the levers of power in Congress. Americans from coast to coast exercised their civic duty. From New York to Ohio, and Georgia where the lines started early. With candidates closing arguments complete and all hands-on deck effort to drive more voters to the polls. Senator R.W canvass with volunteers in Atlanta got a late endorsement from NBA all star L.J. The Democratic incumbent is fending off a challenge against Republican nominee H.W with both candidates hoping to avoid a runoff. Republicans only need five seats to win the majority of the House but the Senate remains a tossup with the Peach State and five others in limbo. New Hampshire is the latest added amid an increasingly competitive contest between incumbent Democrat M.H and GOP election denier D.B. Former President T casted his ballot today in Florida after a last-minute push for Republican Senate candidate J.D, who is up against Democratic Congressman T.R in battleground Ohio. But the former President teed up his own potential 2024 run instead.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 11.07.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.07.22/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Nov 2022 19:16:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.07.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, it’s the final chance for Democrats and Republicans to deliver their closing arguments. Hundreds of candidates are making one last push to get out to vote ahead of Election Day. With control of the Senate and the House on the ballot, both parties are pulling out all the stops, with President J.B, former President B.O and D.T, all hitting the campaign trail. In Georgia, a record 2.5 million voters have already casted their ballots in early voting where Democratic Senator R.W is in a dead heat with Republican H.W.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than forty million people have already cast their ballots nationwide. And here in Georgia, the state hit an all-time record in midterms for early voting. But today was really about trying to get the message out to those remaining voters who will cast their ballots Election Day. On the last full day of campaigning, a final plea to get out the vote. Democratic Senator R.W is fighting to keep his job over Republican challenger H.W. The race is locked in a virtual tie. And if no candidate gets over 50%, it could head to a runoff in December. Florida Governor R.S oversees campaign strategies for Senate Republicans. Georgia is one of the six tossups that could decide the control of US Senate along with Pennsylvania where the razor thin contest between Democrat J.F and Republican Dr. M.O drew three US presidents to the trail. The Senate race in Nevada which between incumbent Senator C.C.M and Republican A.L also a dead heat, brought another former President. Voters, they’re concerned about the top issues dominating this midterm season. While in the Midwest, Lieutenant Governor M.B is trying to squeeze out victory over two-term Republican Senator R.J. Republicans continue to hammer with the economy, part of their closing message to voters while Democrats argue democracy is at stake, a critical choice for voters which is hours to go before polls open across the country.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 11.06.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.06.22/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Nov 2022 18:38:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.06.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We are finally here after months of campaigning, a record of sixteen billion dollars spent. American voters finally get their say Tuesday. More than thirty-nine millions of us have already voted early. Republicans are expected to win big. Democrats are appeared to be scrambling. Today, President B flew to New York campaigning for Governor C.H trying to blend some momentum of her Republican opponent, in an unexpectedly tied race. We’re tracking ten key battleground races, five of which are hotly contested tossups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both parties are trying to deliver their closing arguments and putting out their biggest names from President B in New York tonight to former President T in Florida after crossing paths over the weekend. From Florida to Pennsylvania, an all-out effort to get out vote with four US presidents on the trail. President B reunited with former President O in Philadelphia stumping for Senate nominee J.F and gubernatorial candidate J.S casting their GOP opponents as extremist. Across the keystone states, former President T appeared with GOP ticket mate Dr. M.O and D.M blasting Democrats on the economy, crime and immigration. Pennsylvania is one of the five tossup races that could decide control of the US Senate along with Georgia where Democratic Senator R.W is locked in a statistical tied with GOP Senate nominee H.W. The former football star teamed up with party brass Like former South Carolina governor N.H and Florida Senator R.S. Senate GOP campaign sheriff told CBSN he believes his party will secure at least fifty-two seats in the chamber. Democrats like Arizona Senator M.K remain undeterred fending off a late surge from Republican B.M. The governor’s race is also competitive between Democrat K.H and Republican C.E who has denied results of the 2020 election. Tonight, E’s campaign says it won’t be intimated after an envelope of suspicious white powder was delivered to his headquarters. The FBI responded with Phoenix Police which is now investigating.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 11.05.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.05.22/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Nov 2022 18:20:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.05.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, on this final weekend before Tuesday’s midterms, the parties’ strongest messengers hit the campaign trail, focusing on one state. That battleground, Pennsylvania, the political heavy weights rally voters in the fight that could define the country well beyond this election. Tonight, President J.B stumped together with former President B.O in Philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pennsylvania is packed with presidents today in a sign of just how critical this state is in midterm election campaign. President B and former President O are here in Philadelphia to campaign for J.F. And in another part of the state, former President T is here to campaign for M.O. This is a very close race that will likely to determine which party controls the Senate. O, laying out the states, first in Pittsburgh, B starting his days in the Chicago suburbs. The headwinds facing Democrats are strong, and incumbents in several states are locked in close races. Even with news Friday of approved job numbers, voters remain anxious about rising costs of goods and gas. F responding to voters’ economic concerns by swiping at incorporate America. The keystone state is critical to Republican who hopes reclaiming a majority in the Senate and stopping the B agenda. Without it, the GOP have to flip two other battlegrounds, races in Georgia, Nevada and Arizona remain toss ups. And T maybe here for O, another candidate, but he also has 2024 on his mind. He’s likely to launch another presidential campaign later this month. So, these dueling rallies could be a preview of what’s to come.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 11.04.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.04.22/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Nov 2022 22:02:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.04.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, we are tracking severe weather with millions in the path of dangerous storms, we’ll have more on that in just a minute. But first, which is four days into the midterms, we want to begin with the candidates who is not on the ballot, but looming over election day. Tonight, D.T is hinting he’s ready to jump to the 2024 presidential race, teasing announcement to supporters in Iowa. Advisors familiar with the former President’s plan tell CBSN that T is considering making his widely rumored bid for the White House official in the coming weeks. T is hoping to get out in front of any GOP challengers for the party’s nomination and to ride Republican victories in the midterms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While most of Congressional Republicans tonight are focused on next week’s midterms, former President T’s shadow hovers over the final days. He is moving toward a possible 2024 presidential campaign which could come sooner than later. And behind the scenes, the discussion is more than just a wink. CBSN has learned that T has told aides and donors in recent days that he is considering a 2024 presidential bid and could announce in two weeks before Thanksgiving with the hope of capitalizing unexpected GOP gains in midterms. By jumping in early, T might hope to box out potential primary challengers including his former VP. T allies say some in his inner circle believe a third run for the White House could shield him from multiple ongoing probes, including his effort to overturn the 2020 election, handling of records marked classified and the Capitol Attack. Veteran Democrats tell CBSN tonight that if T jumps this month, it could prompt President B to make his announcement about 2024 in coming weeks, setting up a potential rematch of 2020 election.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 11.03.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.03.22/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Nov 2022 18:57:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.03.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;There is breaking news about Speaker P’s husband P, he is out of the hospital. We’ll have more on that in just a minute. But first, the final sprint to the Midterm Elections is underway as both parties are bringing up the heavy hitters. President B and former President O and T are getting the campaign trail and crisscrossing the country in hopes of turning out the vote. The non-partisan research group OpenSecrets says this election is on track to be the most expensive midterms in history with nearly $17 billion expected to be spent in states and federal races. And with just five days to go into the election, more than thirty-three million voters have already casted their ballots. One of the most closely race remains the one in Pennsylvania where Democrat J.F and Republican M.O are neck and neck according to recent polls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next week, control of the Senate could come down to Pennsylvania, and Democrats are counting on J.F to push through a thicket of attacks and personal challenges in the closing days of this race. Some Democratic strategists they doubt President B speech last night, warning about threats to democracy would be welcomed by candidates in tough races. CBSN reached down to the O campaign for further comment. We’ve not yet heard back. Meanwhile, former President T will be in Pennsylvania this weekend, so will President B and former President B.O&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 11.02.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.02.22/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Nov 2022 18:15:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.02.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, President B is calling on all Americans to stand up to protect our democracy amid the threats that election deniers quote “pose to the voting process”. The White House says the President is seeking common ground with voters that our country’s future is more important than political parties. All these is taking place as the House continues to investigate the Jan.6th attack on the Capitol which thousands attempted to interfere with the verification of the 2020 presidential election. And it comes just days after the alleged attempted murder of House Speaker N.P’s husband by an attacker who broke their San Francisco home with the intent to kidnap her. And with just six days until the midterms. A number of Republican candidates suggest that they would not accept the results unless they are declared the winner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;White House officials say that the President had been intending to turn to this topic for weeks but the issue took on added urgency after the attack on P.P. Republicans argue it’s simply attempted to change the subject and demonize them in the closing stretch of a rough campaign. An ominous warning from President B who argued democracy itself will be on the ballot next week. Two years after that election in 2020, there is still no evidence of systematic voting problems. In his speech, President B argued that election lies and conspiracy theories could spark chaos once again, the way they did on Jan.6th.&lt;/p&gt;

The police chief said that when police arrived at 2:31 AM on Friday, there were only two people in the home, D and P. He remains in the hospital tonight after undergoing surgery for a skull fracture, and the Speaker is by his side.&lt;/p&gt;

According to a federal affidavit, forty-two-year-old D.D was found with zip ties, a roll of tape, white rope, a pair of rubber and cloth gloves, and two hammers including one used in the assault. In an interview with police, D.D called Speaker P the leader of the pack of lies told by the Democratic party, said he planned to hold N hostage and talk to her. And if she lied to him, he would break N’s kneecaps, she would then have to be wheeled into the Congress, which would show other members of Congress, there were consequences to actions. D, who has a history of espousing far right conspiracies online, broke into the P’s home early Friday morning, and demanded to see Speaker P who was in Washington. P.P who was home alone, managed to call 911 from the bathroom, when police arrived, D got a hold of the hammer and struck him in the several times, knocking him unconscious. Tonight, the eighty-two-year-old is recovering in the ICU from a depressed skull fracture. His son visited him this weekend.

The suspect meanwhile will be officially charged tomorrow. He is expected to be arraigned on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commenting for the first time this weekend, N.P says her family is heart broken and traumatized. Meanwhile tonight, her husband P.P remains hospitalized. Tonight, eighty-two-year-old P.P is recovering after surgery for a fractured skull. Sources tell CBSN it could have been worse. P held off the attack by asking the intruder to use the bathroom, that’s why he called 911 for help. The suspect, forty-two years old, D.D, who had a history of spreading political conspiracy theories online, allegedly stroke P with a hammer before being tackled by police. Sources say D was looking for N.P who was in Washington at the time. The violence comes as threat against politicians are at an all-time high and just days before Midterm Elections where some calls to get out the vote have taken aimed the Speaker. And San Francisco Police have since gone on the record saying these two men didn’t know each other before the attack. They say there is no doubt this was break-in.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 10.28.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.28.22/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Oct 2022 18:03:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.28.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We want to begin with the breaking news from San Francisco in the new details about the condition of the husband of Speaker of the House N.P. The eighty-two-year-old is out of surgery tonight as doctor say the effort to repair a skull fracture was successful. His right arm and hand are also seriously injured after a horrifying attack with the hammer inside the couple’s home. N.P was right here in Washington at the time of the attack. But she quickly flew across the country to P.P hospital bedside today. The suspect is in custody after police say he smashed into P’s home and demanded to see the Speaker. The forty-two-year-old is now facing attempt of murder charges. The brutal attack comes eleven days before the Midterm Elections with political tensions running high and law enforcement now warning a potential violence in the runup towards election day. The attack has caused reignited calls for additional protections for family members of America’s leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty-one months after rioters stormed the US Capitol, some yelling “Where is N?”, a California man is accused of storming her house, attacking her husband and asking “Where is N?”. P first responded to the break-in in 7AM inside the P’s home in the wealthy Pacific heights neighborhood in San Francisco. Police say D.D, a forty-two-year-old from nearby Berkley, broke through the back door with a hammer. The broken glass is still visible today. He allegedly attacked P.P, yelled “Where is N?”. Sources say the eighty-two-year-old P.P who had been married N.P for nearly sixty years was hit several times in the head with the hammer, one below was significant. The Speaker’s office said “He underwent surgery this afternoon to repair a skull fracture and serious injuries to his right arm and hands.” A motive hasn’t been determined but sources tell CBSN it was a targeted attack and the suspect intended to tie up P.P and wait for the Speaker return.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 10.27.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.27.22/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Oct 2022 18:52:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.27.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, we return to a community still in pain, still searching for answers and still wondering why it took police more than an hour to enter the classroom where a gunman was murdering fourth graders. At a hearing today, families had their first face to face confrontation with Texas Public Safety Chief. He is the one in-charge of the dozens in State troopers who waited in the hallway during the deadliest elementary school shooting in a decade. Today, Colonel S.M admitted his officers made mistakes but defiantly refuse to step down. Grieving family members told M he has disgraced the state of Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Family members say the lack of information and accountability now five months after the shooting makes them feel like they are being victimized all over again. Angry family of Uvalde victims demanding the resignation of DPS Director S.M. M previously said he would step down if any of his officers had culpability in the botched response. One trooper, J.M was fired last week for his inaction and others are under investigation. M can be seen in this body cam video obtained by a San Antonio station. The video also contains audio of unidentified officers concerned about their own safety while the gunman was inside with the children. But in today’s hearing his first public comments since June, M was defiant. M today said the DPS investigation is continuing and will be presented to district attorney by year’s end.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 10.26.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.26.22/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Oct 2022 18:20:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.26.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, there are major developments that could potentially shake up the Midterm Elections in two key political battlegrounds. The breaking news from Georgia, Republican Senate candidate, H.W is denying new accusations that he paid for another woman to have abortion three decades ago. The accuser said she is afraid of retaliation and wants to remain anonymous. And in Pennsylvania, there are concerns tonight from Democrats after the Senate debate between J.F and O. Races a toss up and F’s performance last night is raising new questions about F’s recovery from the stroke. These races are important because they could decide the balance of power in the Senate. And the latest battleground tracker shows Republicans now have a slightly advantage, at least five races are toss ups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new claim comes as H.W ??? when Democrat Senator R.W and amid record early voting turned out in Georgia. W recently told me he was trying to move forward with his campaign. Now he is defending another allegation that he says lies. In a virtual news conference, Attorney G introduced J.D concealing the identity of a woman who claims W drove her to an abortion clinic in the Spring of 1993 after learning she pregnant. The woman described a six years relationship with W while he was still married and playing at the NFL. She said she tried to get abortion herself but couldn’t go through with it and says he took her to a Dallas area clinic the next day and waited for her while she got the procedure. W played down the allegations on the campaign trail along with South Carolina Senator L.G. It is the latest case to envelop W who recently admitted to writing check for another woman who claimed he paid for her abortion in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 10.25.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.25.22/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Oct 2022 18:09:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.25.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Law enforcement is on alert tonight after we learned disturbing new details from the deadly shooting Monday at a high school in St. Louis. Police found a notebook in the gunman’s car, inside, a handwritten note and ultimately, a window into his motive. The nineteen-year-old shooter was a former student. He managed to get inside, even though the building was locked with seven security guards on duty. Two people were killed including fifteen-year-old student and a teacher who was getting ready to retire. Several others were wounded, the gunman was killed by police. Tonight, the school remains closed and riddled with bullets. The community is mourning as survivors deal with the trauma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The St. Louis police commissioner said that shooting could have been so much worse because the gunman entered the school fully loaded. Police said that he had ammunitions strapped to his chest, and they even found magazine clips in the stairwells of the school. Police sources say that the evidence collected suggests a high level of pre-planning. Tonight, police said the gunman was carrying an arsenal that could have caused much more damaging and death. Police identified the shooter as nineteen-year-old O.H. He was also armed with more than six hundred rounds of ammunition. Police identified the two victims as tenth grader A.B and sixty-one-year-old J.K. Police say they killed the gunman. Authorities say they found a handwritten note in the gunman’s car with a list of school shootings across the country, adding that he wanted to be the next national school shooter. Police are urging the public to stay alert to the next potential threat. Law enforcement officials are concerning about the potential for copycats, and that’s why they’re asking the public that if you see something say something. According to the FBI, the majority of these cases, people who see signs of trouble before mass shootings often they don’t call police.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 10.24.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.24.22/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Oct 2022 18:47:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.24.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We are starting tonight with horror in the heartland of America. Another school shooting, this time in St. Louis. It happened today at the city’s central visual??? performing high school. Terrified students leaving their school with hands raised escaping the senseless horror bullet and??? bloodshed in their hallways in classrooms. A teenage girl was pronounced dead inside the school. Another victim, a teacher, died at the hospital. The gun believed to be in his twenties was killed in battle with police. This was the fortieth school shooting in the US this year. That’s a half dozen more than all of last year. The mayor of St. Louis spoke for so many parents today saying our children shouldn’t have to experience this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a horrifying chaotic scene here that played out at school. The victims ranging in age from sixty-one years old to just fifteen. The shooting sending students scrambling to safety jumping out of the windows and finding any door they could find. It was just after 9A.M when an all too familiar scene erupted. Police raced to central visual and performing arts high school. Traumatized students ran for their lives. Relatives rushed to their loved ones. Police identified the gunman as nineteen-year-old O.H. Students say he entered the school with a long gun then opened fire killing sixty years old and jurying at least seven others. Teacher G.K who passionately raised money for diabetes research later died at the hospital. As the community mourned, there are questions about safety at the school where authorities say seven security personnel were on duty at the time. Investigators located the suspect’s car and are searching for more clues to the gunman’s motive. Now agents with the ATF and the FBI were seen searching a home connected to that gunman. This afternoon, again the ATF and the FBI seen searching that home for several hours here in south St. Louis, he is set to be a nineteen-year-old male, graduated from the school just last year. Tonight, the communities plan to hold a vigil.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 10.23.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.23.22/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Oct 2022 19:59:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.23.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with the fast-approaching Midterm Elections. Both parties are pressing hard to show why they deserve your vote. Democrats, focus on legislative accomplishments, Republicans on the economy and crime. At stake, both Houses of Congress votes are already being case on many states across the country in person and by mail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a quiet week at home in Delaware, President B will head to Pennsylvania this week, and Florida the next as we come to the home stretch of this contentious Midterm Election. On Face the Nation today, Speaker of the House N.P said the results of the Midterms will be decided in the last minutes of the race. But the latest CBSN battleground tracker poll has the House likely going Republicans and the Senate at a fifty-fifty split. The surge of supporting Democrats saw on the summer following the overturn of Roe V Wade has faded as Republicans are trying to focus voters on issues like crime, immigration and economy. In several key races, including a tie up Arizona Senate, Republican candidates have openly questioned the results of the 2020 election. And President B said in an interview this weekend that he could run again in 2024 but he won’t make that decision officially until after the Midterm Elections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fight over the fifty-fifty Senate is fierce especially in the battleground state of Pennsylvania. This week, Democrat Lt. Governor J.F, Republican Dr. M.O are set to debate.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 10.22.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.22.22/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Oct 2022 18:32:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.22.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;It’s not even November, but turnout for the crucial, 2022 Midterm Election already ??? Election Day is still seventeen days away. But several states have seen a surge of voters casting early ballot. This is Clark County, Nevada where in person voting begins today. There is a lot at stake at levels of government including control of Congress and the future of President B’s agenda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across the country, more than seven million Americans have already casted their ballots as the candidates and the White House make their closing arguments. President B trying to sound optimistic as the latest polls show Democrats losing some of their summer momentum ahead of November. In Nevada and Arizona, Democrats are fighting to keep their seats in two tossed up Senate races. The Georgia Senate race is also a tie. This week, Democratic Senator R.M launched a new attack ad against his opponent, highlighting accusations of anti-abortion rights Republican once paid for his partner’s abortion. And across the country, there is another concern, win, lose or draw, will Americans accept the outcome? According to the FBI, seven states have seen unusual threat levels against election workers. The White House just announced that the President is going to Florida in early November, but he is staying away from some of really tied races and places where Democrats think his low approval rating might hurt the candidates as they try to appeal to independent voters.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 10.21.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.21.22/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Oct 2022 10:20:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.21.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We want to begin with what is likely to become an historically legal battle unlike any other in American history as Congress today ordered former President D.T to testify under oath. The Jan.6th committee follow through on its unanimous vote to subpoena the former President for documents and his testimony related to his false allegations about the 2020 presidential elections. In a letter, Chairman B.T and Vice Chairman L.C write that the committee has gathered quote” overwhelming evidence” that T personally orchestrated a multi-step effort to overturn the 2020 election and obstruct the peaceful transition of power. This comes on the same day long-time T ally S.B was sentenced to four months in prison for defying the subpoena from the very same committee. B remains free tonight as he appeals his conviction. Plus, we are learning those details about those classify documents seized from Mar-a-Lago in August.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than a year to its probe, the House January 6th elected Committee wants to put the man of the center of its investigation under oath, seeking critical records from D.T by November 4th that’s four days before the Midterm Election. And seeking his deposition one week after. The Jan.6th Committee today demanded testimony and documents from the former president, arguing he has played a central role in trying to subvert the election and triggered the assault on the Capitol. In the letter accompanying the subpoena, they write the evidence demonstrate that you knew this activity was illegal and unconstitutional, and also knew that your assertions of fraud were false. The Committee wants information about T’s dealings with key players who already pleaded with the 5th plus all his communications by phone, text or the private messaging app on Jan.6th. They also want any information referring to the proud boys, oath keepers or other militia groups. A source tells CBSN that among the documents seized on August 8th that T’s Florida estate was ??? containing information Iran missile program and another including highly sensitive intelligence work aimed China. Material that exposed could jeopardize foreign sources or even prompted other countries to retaliate against the US. Meanwhile, former T’s top aid, S.B was reprimanded in a federal court in Washington for families for failing to comply with the Jan.6th Committee’s subpoena.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 10.20.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.20.22/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Oct 2022 18:38:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.20.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We want to begin with some important health news for families. In recent week across the country, there has been an alarming increase of an illness among young children. And it’s not Covid, it’s something called RSV. Hospitals in at least thirty-three are seeing a dramatic rise in cases in children suffering from the respiratory virus. Cases have doubled in more than twenty-five states in the last month. And it’s putting a strain on the hospitals. Some healthcare facilities are so overwhelmed that they are running of beds. The state of Connecticut is even thinking about bringing in the National Guard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight, hospitals from Texas to Connecticut are sounding the alarms. Emergency rooms are filling with RSV patients. There is no vaccine and doctors are bracing for a rough winter. At Connecticut children medical center, doctors are slammed with the surge in RSV cases. RSV cases typically peaked in December to mid-February. But this month, the hospital has more RSV cases than any other respiratory illness including Covid. Further south, almost all of the ICU beds at Cook Children’s Hospital in Fort Worth, Texas are filled with RSV patients. RSV symptoms are similar to a cold, but doctor say, parents should watch signs of respiratory distress. If their child’s nostrils are flaring while breathing or if their skin is pulling in towards their ribs. Doctors are asking patients to get the flu shots. It won’t prevent the flu but it could make their symptoms milder which could prevent them from having to make a trip to already busy emergency room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, political shockwaves across the pond tonight after British Prime Minister L.T resigned suddenly. Just six weeks into her term. T is stepping down after her economic policies sent shockwaves through the financial markets.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 10.19.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.19.22/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Oct 2022 20:15:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.19.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We’ll get to that breaking news about those guns found near the Supreme Court and the arrest in just a minute. But we do want to begin overseas amid Russia’s failing invasion. The Kremlin continues to target Ukraine’s infrastructure including power plants and the nation’s water supply as winter cold sets in. As Russian troops suffered setbacks on the battlefield. President V.P is tightening his grip by declaring martial law on four regions claimed by Moscow. Well, tonight we are seeing massive evacuations in the southern city of Kherson, with up to sixty thousand being moved out of the city while the Ukrainian counteroffensive closer every day. And then there is this breaking news. The US charges five Russia nationals with evading sanctions. The Justice Department saying they purchased sensitive military technology and shipped those materials to Russian buyers. Some of those electronics have been found in Russia weapons found on the battlefield in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;V.P’s announcement of martial law today could be a sign that his invading army has run into serious problems. Today, in Kherson, one of the regions occupied by Russia, the authorities installed by Moscow started moving tens of thousands of people away from the frontline ahead of expected Ukrainian counteroffensive. The Russian general in charge of the invasion admitted the situation is tense, as Russian troops battled to hold onto land they have seized. Ukraine’s military has made stunning progress in recent weeks, reclaiming swathes of territory from Russian forces. Russia retaliated with swarms of so-called suicide drones and attacks on the power grid as a harsh winter looms. But Ukrainians have responded with stunning resilience. Ukraine has repeatedly made a formal request to Israel to provide it with new air defense systems including Iron Dome. But Israel consistently said that it won’t give weapons to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 10.18.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.18.22/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Oct 2022 20:29:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.18.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, winter has come earlier for a majority of the country with more than two hundred and thirty five million Americans experiencing below normal temperature from the upper Midwest to the Gulf of Mexico. October snow has fallen across the Midwest, including Wisconsin, Michigan, Indiana, and even dipped as far south as Kentucky, with some areas seeing as much as a foot and a half and more is on the way. In Minnesota, wind chills dipped below zero this morning while more than one hundred million Americans are under freeze and frost advisory tonight from the Rockies to the Northeast. The cold front will push temperatures ten to twenty degrees below normal from the central plains to the Florida panhandle. And some areas will set historic lows with at least seventy-five records expected to be broken tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fall feels like winter in parts of the upper Midwest, thanks to a weather system dropping temperatures and snow. Instead of falling leaves, more than a foot of snow blanketed parts of Michigan, leaving a mess for work crews. In the last forty-eight hours, Ironwood and Marquette, Michigan recorded more than thirteen inches of snow. In Indiana, thick flakes of snow peppered parking lots and roadways, making for slick driving conditions. And instead of white Christmas, the early snow had people wondering about a white Halloween. While the temperature maybe dropping, the cost of heating home is going up. The average cost to stay cozy indoors this winter is expected to rise more than seventeen percent, about two hundred dollars over last year, thanks, in part, to the rising cost of natural gas. One energy expert we talked to said home heating prices here in Texas could be up as much as thirty percent compared to last year. Here in Dallas, it’s weather whiplash. It was in the 90s this past weekend, and now parts of north Texas are under freeze warnings.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 10.17.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.17.22/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Oct 2022 18:49:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.17.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We want to begin tonight overseas with the war in Ukraine where Russia is inflicting a type of terror on several major cities using Iranian kamikaze drones. The unmanned aircraft are small but pack a heavy punch and explode on impact. Today, raining down from the sky during the morning rush hour and rocking residential buildings. Ukrainian President Z says his military was able to shoot down thirty-seven drones. But the wave of the attacks killed at least four including a woman with six months pregnant. Inside the Russia and near the border of Ukraine, a fighter jet crashed into a nine-story building. Russian news agencies report that plane’s engine was caught fire during a training exercise and the pilots were able to eject. One hundred and eight Ukrainian women are freed tonight after being in Russian captivity. Some were prisoners before the war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After months of relative calm in Kiev, today, the city was pummeled for the second time in as many weeks. And some experts believe Russian was running short in ammunitions. Russian forces have begun using a new weapon with devastating effects. Early this morning, a swarm of so-called suicide drones bombarded Ukraine’s capital. Kamikaze weapons packed with deadly explosives that detonate on impact. They have been used to attack frequently in recent weeks. Today, they rained down on city’s streets. Russia has repeatedly claimed that it doesn’t target civilians. But this neighborhood in Kiev is home to apartment buildings, restaurants and schools. Kiev’s mayor, V,K called Russia a terrorists state. Ukraine says it has shot down some of the drones today. This video appears to show Ukrainian police officers making a successful hit. But they’re small and apparently difficult to track on radar. They’re also cheap. Some reportedly selling for around twenty thousand dollars each. The US says Iran has agreed to provide hundred of drones for Russia for use in Ukraine. But Iran denies it. On the weekend, Russia blamed Ukraine for strikes injured civilians in the city of Belgorod, which is just over the border. One of the drones in this morning’s attack appear to have for Belgorod inscribed on it. Apparently, an act of retaliation. Ukraine’s President V.Z claims Russia made an even bigger order from Iran, putting the figure at nearly two and a half thousand suicide drones.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CSB Evening News 10.16.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/csb-evening-news-10.16.22/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Oct 2022 17:46:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/csb-evening-news-10.16.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Police in Stockton, California say they’re certain they have the serial killer authorities have been searching for. The news is providing some relief to a community that’s felt terrorized for several months. The arrest was made this weekend. The suspect, forty-three-year-old W.B. He is expected to be arraigned on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tips from the community and good old fashioned police work led to the suspected killer, a Stockton resident. Investigators say the arrest came just as he was on the &lt;strong&gt;prowl&lt;/strong&gt; for his next victim. Police say this is the serial killer who had the community of Stockton frozen in fear for three months. Forty-three-year-old W.B’s arrest came as a relief to anxious residents of the city eighty miles east of San Francisco. Investigators say they zeroed in on B.W Saturday as he drove through the dark streets of Stockton armed with a handgun searching for his next victim. Authorities say ballistics linked B to seven shootings, six of them deadly. Five men ambushed between July and September in Stockton and another man last year in Oakland. Police also linked B to the shooting of a woman last year, she survived. The district attorney will announce charges during his arraignment Tuesday calling this a very fluid and ongoing investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the midterms fast approaching, a new CBSN poll out today shows Republicans are still favored to capture the House with an estimated 224 seats majority. Democrats have been narrowing the gap. But that momentum has stalled.&lt;/p&gt;

Tonight, Mr. B stumped in Portland with control of Congress and the future of his agenda at stake. It was the last stop on a four-day swing through Oregon, California and Colorado.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the President is doing everything he can to boost his party’s bid to keep control on Capitol Hill, looking to lock up key votes in key areas where his approval rating is up. President B wrapped up his West Coast swing with a final stop in Oregon, touting his legislative victories, including the Inflation Reduction Act. Mr. B’s trip caps a four-day stretch where he keyed in on his administration work so far as the clock ticks, the Midterm Elections a few weeks away and power on Capitol Hill hanging in the ballots. In contrast, President T and O racked up with thousands of miles, crisscrossing the country, making their final cases to voters ahead of the midterms. And in states where races at the top of tickets are highly contested, some say a B’s presence, based on his approval rating, could make or break the outcome. Now, voters will see former President O along the campaign trail. He’s expected to stump in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Georgia at the end of the month. We’ll also see former President T hit the road as well on behalf the GOP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Georgia is home to one of the most competitive Senate races.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 10.15.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.15.22/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Oct 2022 18:09:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.15.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We want to begin with what is now becoming all too common, another mass shooting in America. This time, in a quiet suburb of Raleigh, North Carolina. Police are searching for a motive in the shooting rampage that killed five people. The fifteen-year-old suspect is in critical condition in a North Carolina hospital. The victims include the suspect’s own brother, a sixteen-year-old high school student. And a twenty-nine-year-old off duty police officer. The other victims, all women, range in age from thirty-four to fifty-two. The Thursday afternoon shootings began hours long manhunt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wake County district attorney is expected to charge that fifteen-year-old suspect as an adult. C is one of five victims killed in yesterday’s shooting. Now police have not named the suspect, his motive is not known. This is the nation’s 25th mass murder this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back here in Washington, former President D.T has sent a message to the January 6 committee after unanimously voted to issue him a subpoena. Instead of answering questions or agreeing to testify, the former president used his rambling fourteen-page letter to attack the panel and its members.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 10.13.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.13.22/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Oct 2022 18:17:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.13.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;It was a dramatic ending to what’s expected to be the final Jan.6th hearing, a vote to subpoena former President T to appear before Congress. And it came after shocking new evidence and never before seen video. That video showed congressional leaders at a secure location including House Speaker N.P calling state and federal officials to plead for help. Investigators laid out today in vivid detail why they believe the attack on Capitol was not a spur of the moment decision but a premeditated plan, months in the making to overturn the will of people and the 2020 election. The committee today placed the blame squarely on one person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a year-long investigation and a series of congressional hearings unlike we’ve ever seen before, House select Jan.6th committee voted unanimously to take its probe to the next level, calling former President T the central figure of Jan.6th. With just weeks remaining to finish its work, the House select Jan.6th committee made the stunning move calling on the former President to testify. The committee argued T agitated the crowd then directed them to the Capitol knowing some were armed and angry. In a statement tonight, the former President called the committee a total bust that has only served to further divide our country. Four top T aides defied subpoenas from this committee. But two are being prosecuted for contempt of Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, there is outrage tonight in Florida from the parents of the victims of the Parkland School shooting. A jury spared convicted killer from the death penalty and instead recommended a sentence of life without parole for the 2018 massacre of 17 students and staff.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 10.12.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.12.22/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Oct 2022 18:39:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.12.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We want to begin with breaking news in what is the largest defamation suit payout ever in American history. The landmark verdict awarded the families of those killed in the Sandy Hook massacre. Parents who lost their young children and then faced a decade torment, a small sliver of justice. A Connecticut jury ordered far-right Infowars Host, A.J to pay nearly a billion dollars in damages for spreading lies about the elementary school shooting. The 2012 massacre in Newtown, Connecticut killed twenty children and six adults in the deadliest elementary school shooting in the nation’s history. J has falsely told millions of his radio show listeners that it was staged as part of government plot to confiscate guns, while relatives of the victims allege the conspiracy theorist then profited from those lies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This trial which is gone on for a month, has forced the victim’s family members to relive unthinkable trauma. As the verdict was read this afternoon, I was sitting next to several parents who lost their young children. They were all emotional but strong and they tell me this accountability is what they were fighting for. It took six jurors less than three days to come up with a price tag. More than nine hundred and sixty-five million dollars the conspiracy theorist A.J must pay for spreading false claims that the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting was a hoax. J and his company Free Speech System were sued by eight victims’ families and an FBI agent who responded to the shooting that took the lives of twenty students and six staff. Judge B.B had already found Infowars Host liable for defamation. It is unlikely the victims’ families will receive the full payout. All along, A.J’s attorney has said J is not responsible for the actions of his listeners. And in his first trial, J was already ordered to pay fifty million dollars and he still faces his third trial later this year.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 10.11.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.11.22/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Oct 2022 19:05:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.11.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Russia’s revenge continues as its missiles rained down from the sky across Ukraine for the second straight day. Air-raid siren sounded during the early morning rush hours. Residents took cover in bomb shelters and subway stations. Multiple cities across the country were hit by fresh rockets and kamikaze drone attacks as the death toll continues to rise. Russia’s military appears to be targeting residential areas that including a school and a medical facility in the contested city of Zaporizhian. President B and other G7 leaders held an emergency meeting today and pledged to stay firmly with Ukraine. And tonight, we’re learning details about the sophisticated weapons that could be headed to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his nightly address moments ago, President Z said Russia launched another twenty-eight missiles into Ukraine today. On the same day, he pleaded with G7 for modern air defense systems saying the key element of Russia’s terror, rocket strikes will cease to work. Ukraine’s Defense Ministry says more than half of at least seventy-five cruise missiles onslaught were intercepted shot down like this video set to show. But wild Kremlin attacks civilian targets. Many of its troops were in retreat on the battlefield. We headed south, where Ukrainian forces smashed through Russian defenses on Kherson region. Not much more than a week ago, this whole area was under Russian control. Russian troops took over local high school as their headquarters. The hole blown into concrete, scorched walls and smashed windows speak of the battle took place when Ukrainian forces closed in. Yesterday’s bombardment has had a huge impact on the civilian infrastructure here cutting off electricity and water in parts of the country. Residents have been asked to conserve energy, shut down businesses early.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 10.10.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.10.22/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Oct 2022 18:18:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.10.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Well, the world’s most powerful western nations are convening on an emergency meeting tomorrow to address the increasing dire situation in Ukraine after Russian targeted civilian areas throughout the country. Major cities were rocked by more than eighty Russia’s missile strikes during a busy morning rush hours what appears to be the largest wave of attacks since the opening of the war. One of the targets included a landmark pedestrian bridge located in the capital of Kiev. P said the attacks were in response to the destruction of a key bridge linking Russia to Crimea over weekend. Well, Ukrainian officials say at least fourteen were killed and nearly one hundred others injured in more than a dozen cities. President B spoke with President Z late today by phone and he pledged to provide support to Ukraine including advance air defense systems that he asked for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight, the US embassy in Kiev has urged all American citizens to leave the country immediately. Air-raid sirens have been blared here all day. Russian forces unleashed a deadly, sustain campaign terror across Ukraine launching its most powerful long-range weapons in the most widespread assault since the invasion began. P’s war machine took aim at more than a dozen cities in a coordinated bombardment. Multiple strikes on the capital Kiev in the heart of downtown. Cars erupting in flames on streets near M square blast, destruct in the middle of rush hour. A smoldering crater near children’s playground. Ukrainian President saying they seek panic and chaos, they have two targets, energy sectors and people. Russia’s retaliation for blowing the bridge leading from Russia to Crimea. President P today calling it a terrorist attack, warning of even worse prices if it’s repeated. Not only disrupting a key Russian supply line but taking a direct swipe in P who personally drove across the bridge as it official opening in 2018. The payback sent Ukrainians scrambling for shelter for the first time in months. Residents in Kiev taking refuge in the city’s subway again. And in another worrying development tonight, the leader of Belarus is announced a joint military taskforce with Russia. Belarus was used as a staging ground for Russian troops in the initial invasion of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 10.09.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.09.22/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Oct 2022 20:57:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.09.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Today, Ukrainian President V.Z warned there will be repercussions after Russia’s deadly missile attack on civilians. Overnight, at least a dozen people were killed and several apartment buildings destroyed in the southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia. Z’s comment on the same day Russian President V.P called a truck bomb attack on the one bridge linking Russia to Crimea a terrorist act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Civilians in Zaporizhzhia once again found themselves a target of Russian military firepower overnight. Missiles rained down on residential neighborhood as families slept, obliterating homes and causing an apartment block to collapsed, spreading terror, death and destruction. The city in the southeast has been on its receiving of Russia’s wraith in recent days. More than sixty civilians have been killed in and around Zaporizhzhia in the past nine days. Yesterday’s strike came on the same night that an explosion tore through the only bridge linking Crimea to the Russian mainland. Moscow blamed a massive truck bomb calling it a terrorist attack. A psychological assault on a hated symbol of Russia’s illegal land grab. Kiev hasn’t officially claimed responsibility but President Z alluded to it in last night’s address. Ukrainian forces have continued to recapture territory in the east and south on the battlefield. Whether the spike in attacks on civilian areas are retaliation, targeted or random doesn’t matter for the victims of the onslaught. And breaking tonight, President V.P said Russian intelligence has accused Ukrainian special services of carrying out the attack on the Crimean bridge. Tomorrow, he holds an emergency security council meeting in Moscow to determine Russia’s response.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 10.07.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.07.22/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Oct 2022 21:11:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.07.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, President B warns that we are closer to a nuclear conflict than at any point since the Cuban missile crisis in 1962. The White House advised that there is no new information that Russia is planning an imminent nuclear attack on Ukraine. But the President’s remark demonstrate that the US is taking V.P’s threats seriously. Especially as events continue to turn against him in Ukraine. Russia’s military continues to lose ground and Russia is losing military-age men as they flee the country to avoid the draft. P has repeatedly reminded the west that nuclear weapons are one of their options in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Midterm Election is coming and voters are concerned about stability and continuity in times of crisis might emerge as an issue. Even so, experts we talk to said the risk of Russian using a nuclear weapon in Ukraine is higher and no small measure because senior Russian leaders have said they deserve the right to use their most dangerous weapons and they’re not bluffing. President B ignored questions on his way to a speech in Maryland this morning after warning, in stark terms, of possible nuclear annihilation. Mr. B said Russian V.P having sustained multiple military setbacks in Ukraine has no clear endgame. P has warned recently, he might use weapons of mass destruction. The White House said today that there is no new intelligence suggesting Russia is taking steps to deploy battlefield nuclear weapons in Ukraine. In an interview with BBC, Ukraine’s President V.Z said talk of nuclear warfare should startle the world. In this tense atmosphere, the B administration announced this week it was purchasing larger quantities of a drug used to treat patients in case of a nuclear or radiological emergency. The Department of Health and Human services said this move was part of an ongoing and quote “long planned” preparation strategy.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 10.06.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.06.22/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Oct 2022 18:51:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.06.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with some breaking news. CBSN has learned that the FBI has gathered what it believes is enough evidence to support charging President B’s son H with crime related to his taxes and gun purchases. The FBI has sent the information to the US attorney’s office in Delaware. An attorney for H.B hit back at allegations in a statement. Attorney C.C said it is a federal felony for a federal agent to leak information about a grand jury investigation such as this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight, there is movement to the H.B’s criminal investigation with sources telling CBSN the FBI believes that it has sufficient evidence against the President son. The yearslong federal investigation to H.B’s businesses began before J.B was President. And sources tell CBSN the FBI believes there is enough evidence to prosecute. That evidence was provided months ago by D.W. The US attorney in Delaware was appointed by President T and he is yet to bring charges. Sources tell CBSN the probe explored whether the younger B, his uncle J and other business associates violated tax, money laundering and foreign lobbying laws. Since the early month this year, the probe narrowed focusing on &lt;strong&gt;delinquent&lt;/strong&gt; tax payments including income H.B earned as a board member for a Ukrainian energy company. The source close to the President son said he paid off more than a million dollars in past-due taxes. Sources familiar with the probe told CBSN investigators were also looking at allegations that H.B made false statements on a gun registration form, and may have disposed of a gun improperly. A lawyer for H.B called the apparently inherently biased, one-sided and inaccurate, adding their team believes prosecution should not be pressured, rushed or criticized for doing their job. President B maintains he is not being briefed on the case. The President has consistently denied knowledge of his son’s work, but congressional Republicans say they will investigate if they take control the committees after the midterm elections.&lt;/p&gt;

The President and the First Lady surveyed the damage before meeting with local residents businesses owners and political rivals including Florida’s governor R.D. One week after the category four storm made landfall, residents and businesses were allowed to returned to Sanibel Island for the first time to see what’s left of their homes. Nearly three hundred thousand customers are still without power and many residents still have no access to water. Disaster recovery centers say they distributed more than nine million meals, thirty-four million bottles of water and five hundred generators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President B announced that FEMA will extend full reimbursement for debris removal for additional thirty days. That’s important in places like Fort Myers Beach. A week after Hurricane Ian left parts of Southwest Florida in ruins. President B toured the damage by air calling it historic and promised long-term support. The President was briefed by Governor R.D who announced the road to isolated Pine Island had been repaired. Also today, anxious residents of nearby Sanibel Island were allowed back for the first time to check on their homes. Returning to scenes like street after unrecognizable street. To help Floridians get back on their feet, FEMA deployed mobile registration centers to process applications for assistance. More than two hundred thousand families have applied, seeking money for foods, clothing and home repairs. Meanwhile, medical personnel from around the country are staffing makeshift medical units from the Department of Health and Services like this one in Cape Coral, to ease the load on local hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 10.04.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.04.22/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Oct 2022 20:05:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.04.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Well tonight, nearly a week after Hurricane Ian ravaged the state of Florida, the long road to recovery has only just begun. More than four hundred thousand customers are still without electricity. Officials in Fort Myers say it could take more than a month before power is full restored. Emergency team’s cadaver dogs have gone door to door to nearly eighty thousand damaged homes and rescued more than two hundred residents. Flooding remains a problem across central Florida as lakes and rivers continue to rise. Well tomorrow, President B will visit the damaged and meet with governor R.D. setting aside their political differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The water has receded from this particular neighborhood. But if you take a look from above, all of the debris, the trash, the ruined furniture that is now out on the street, all of it is the evidence of the onslaught that took place here. Many say the sense of shock they felt after Ian hit is now giving away to a feeling of helplessness. Across Florida, residents are still reeling. Parts of Lee County could be without power for weeks. Schools in eight counties are remain closed some damage beyond repair, and floodwaters near Orlando continue to rise. Tens of thousands still lack the basics, food, running water, housing. To help, the state is handing out ready to eat meals and water, eighteen million bottles so far. But it is not enough. We’ve found volunteers at Gladiolus Food Pantry in Fort Myers operating outside after the building flooded. Before Ian, eight hundred families a month sought assistance here. Since Friday, they’ve served more than sixteen hundred meals. Volunteers are also going door to door getting supplies to those can’t reach them. Among the most vulnerable, the elderly and immigrants who service the region’s agriculture and tourism industries.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 10.03.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.03.22/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Oct 2022 18:47:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.03.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Today, Florida’s residents are reeling from the catastrophic damage of Hurricane Ian. The death toll stands at ninety-five. But sadly, that number is expected to rise. In five days since the storm made landfall, more than a half million are still without power. FEMA’s damage assessment is ongoing. And rescue efforts are still underway. More than two thousand people in Southwest and Central Florida have been brought to safety. One of the hardest-hit areas, Sanibel Island, remains cut off from the mainland with on electricity or running water for most of the residents. Tonight, there are major questions about the delayed evacuation orders in Lee County which took a direct hit. President B will visit Florida on Wednesday to survey the damage. And today he was in Puerto Rico where residents are still recovering from Hurricane Fiona.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frustration is mounting. For many, gas, power and water remain in short supply. And the entire city of Fort Myers Beach has now been closed even to residents so crews can focus on searching for survivors and it is not easy. There are buildings that have been tossed about, mountains of rubble. Tonight, new images of the devastation near Fort Myers Beach as search rescuing team &lt;strong&gt;sift&lt;/strong&gt; through the widespread destructions. As residents struggle to pick up the pieces, there is mounting criticism over the decision not to issue an evacuation order for Lee County until Tuesday, the day before Ian made landfall. That’s despite warnings they were in the storm’s path since Friday. Today, President B toured damage from a different hurricane. Two weeks after Fiona crippled Puerto Rico power grid. He pledged sixty million dollars to help in the recovery. Monday, many coastal counties in Florida began issuing evacuation orders. Fort Myers Beach that morning started encouraging its residents to get out. By Monday night, the town posted on social media the risk was so great people needed to evacuate even though Lee County wouldn’t make evacuation decision until Tuesday morning. When Lee County finally did, it was less than twenty four hours before Ian’s arrival.&lt;/p&gt;

Officials now say as many as eighty-four people were killed in Florida and the Carolinas, at least forty-two in Lee County in Florida home to the city of Fort Myers. Well, this weekend some home owners returned peek through their destroyed homes as the National Guard began the long work of cleaning away the debris. Official said it could be months before power is fully restored to the state. Right now, nearly one million customers are without power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are seaside communities that look like a bomb went off. And for many people these destroyed boats were not only how they earned a living, but also where they lived. As one man told us today, out of the stages of grief, the one he’s in right now is shock. In some areas, not a single boat, home or structure was untouched by Ian. In fact, here on San Carlos Island entire neighborhoods were destroyed. In nearby Fort Myers, residents face long lines for gas and gridlock trying to get back to their homes to survey the damage. Sanibel Island was also devasted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National Hurricane Center is tracking systems that could develop into tropical storms. The first, by the Cape Verde Islands will track north but the second will move to the west and to the Caribbean by midweek. Well, today, the heads of nine NATO members backed to path membership for Ukraine to join the Western alliance. It comes on the heels of another major victory for Ukrainian forces.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 10.01.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.01.22/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Oct 2022 20:17:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-10.01.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, CBSN has learned the number of people who lost their lives to what was Hurricane Ian could be at least seventy-six. But more than a million people without power and countless others with homes totally destroyed. In Fort Myers beach which took a direct hit local officials say ninety percent of that town is effectively gone. And coastal South Carolina also slammed by Ian suffered massive flooding. Ian still lingers, bringing thunderstorms and rains to the upper Mid-Atlantic tonight and Northeast tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cleanup is well underway here in downtown Fort Myers. But unfortunately for many business owners that means get rid of almost everything. And to this day, the dangers of Hurricane Ian persist for this area, this time in the form of flood waters from upstream. Some of the same areas that Ian pummeled with winds are now inundated by the runoff from rain that fell inland. The water rose fast around some residents of North Port, Florida who had to be rescued emergency crews and volunteers including a group that calls itself the Cajun Navy. Since Ian made landfall more than four thousand people have been rescued from flooded neighborhoods or the barrier islands like Sanibel, which remains inaccessible and Fort Myers Beach, where destruction is visible for miles. Long lines are forming at food and water distribution sites. So far Florida governor says eighty-seven hundred people have registered for FEMA assistance that number is certain to climb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, massive cleanup efforts are also underway in parts of South Carolina after Ian tore through its coastal region. The resort city of Myrtle Beach suffered some of the worst damage in the state.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 09.30.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.30.22/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Oct 2022 21:49:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.30.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;As we come on the air, Ian is now a post-tropical cyclone. But it is still bringing dangerous conditions to much of the east coast. Ian slammed into the South Carolina’s coast as a strong category one storm packing winds of eighty-five miles per hour. The storm made landfall in the US for the second time near the historic town of Georgetown. With torrential rains and floodwaters. South Carolina’s governor is urging residents to stay inside. The storm will continue to bring flooding rains from the Carolinas to the mid-Atlantic and even up to New York over the weekend. Tonight, we are getting a clear picture of the devastation Hurricane Ian left behind in the state of Florida. There are rescues happening right now. It could also be the most expensive storm in Florida’s history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight, there is a state of emergency caused by Ian in five Southeast states. Ian smacks every place hard. Today, the South Carolina coast, places like Charleston, and Pawleys Island. Police there called flooding catastrophic. In Cherry Grove, the local pier washed away into the Atlantic. This category one hurricane brought misery galore, eighty-five miles per hour winds up to seven feet of storm surge, and in some spots, eight inches of rain. And when there is too much water a half block from Myrtle Beach itself, we watched this rescue, apartment residents trapped by a moat four feet deep &lt;strong&gt;plucked&lt;/strong&gt; to safety by fire crews. South of here is the South Carolina region known as the Lowcountry. Areas that are at sea level or below, vulnerable to flooding. And tonight, overwhelmed by water. Turning to the devastation in Florida where rescuers are still underway and expected to continue until tomorrow. President B says this search operation is the largest in recent history. In Orlando, entire neighborhoods remain underwater as getting up to fourteen inches of rain.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 09.29.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.29.22/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Sep 2022 19:08:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.29.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;As we come on the air tonight, Ian has regained hurricane strength as it moves into the Atlantic taking aim at Georgia and the Carolinas. But what had left behind here in Florida is unimaginable in scale and historic in reach. The President saying tonight this could be the deadliest hurricane in Florida’s history. We witnessed the trail of destruction this category four storm left. Florida governor R.D said today this is a once in five-hundred-year flooding event. The hurricane forced winds and record storm surge cost widespread damage to entire communities in cities, washing away roads and bridges and knocking out power to millions. Tonight, more than 2.6 million customers are without electricity and officials are warning this could be days or even weeks before power is full restored. Tonight, the states of Georgia, the Carolinas and Virginia were all have to declare a state of emergency ahead of Ian’s expected landfall tomorrow. We have team coverage tonight all throughout Florida and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As daylight probe, the path of destruction left behind by Hurricane Ian was devastating. Block by block, Fort Myers beach looks like a was hit by a bomb. Only small pieces of debris remain where homes and businesses once stood. Ian came at shore as a category four hurricane. The storm surge was so powerful in Naples, it’s swept homes from their foundations. The destruction was just as overwhelming in Lee County where many roads are impassable and entire neighborhoods sit underwater. Today, governor R.D called the damage on some of the barrier islands biblical. President B is now planning a trip to the disaster area to thank responders. Folks in this area describing Ian as someone beating on their eardrums nine hours as they watched their neighbors’ homes being torn apart.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 09.28</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.28/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Sep 2022 18:52:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.28/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;As we come on the air, the state of Florida is being pummeled by Hurricane Ian. The massive category four storm made landfall this afternoon with winds at a hundred and fifty miles per hour. But at this hour, Ian is a still dangerous category three hurricane. Ian slammed shore of north of Fort Myers with dangerous winds and catastrophic storm surge. Tonight, hurricane Ian is dumping tremendous amounts of rain along the I-4 quarter. The National Weather Service says Ian has already dropped eighteen inches of rain. Ian has knocked out power to nearly two million customers throughout the state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sheriffs are telling us that their phone lines are flooded with 911 calls of people trapped in their homes by water and the deputies are going out to rescue them. This as this massive storm continue to pound Florida’s Gulf Coast. This was Fort Myers as Hurricane Ian made landfall this afternoon. What was ??? now underwater, with fears of more catastrophic flooding to come. In twenty four hours this before and after photos show the worsening conditions. ??? island was among the first fields Ian as it came to shore, causing major flooding. Residents were among two and half million people who were told to evacuate, some chose to stay. As Ian came on shore, it overturned homes and submerged cars. In Naples, a fallen trees downed powerlines sparked fires and made roads impassable. Several counties in the path of the storm issued emergency curfews starting tonight. Here in Bradenton, we expect a storm surge of seven to ten feet.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 09.27.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.27.22/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Sep 2022 19:08:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.27.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Florida is a state on the edge tonight as it prepares for what could be the biggest storm in years. The major news tonight is that the path of hurricane has shifted, pushing the storm to an earlier landfall and further south than where we are tonight. Two and half residents are under mandatory or voluntary evacuation orders as the outer bands of Hurricane Ian reached the southern parts of the state. Florida Director of Emergency management said more than one hundred nursing homes and hospitals in the Tampa areas have been evacuated. Grocery stores up and down the coast are packed as the residents rushed to grab last minute supplies. But many are finding nothing but empty shelves. Hurricane Ian slammed to Cuba as a category three storm with winds of a hundred twenty miles per hour, knocking out power to more than a million people. And the storm is gaining strength in the open water of Gulf of Mexico. Check out this satellite images showing the eye of the storm packed with lightning. One of the biggest concerns is that Ian could dump record amounts of rain and cost danger storm surge across six hundred miles of coast lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tampa hasn’t taken a direct hit from Hurricane since 1921 and even thought the city may dodge Ian’s bullet, people here aren’t taking any chances. Floridians are on the move. All along Florida’s gulf coast thousands of residents are heading inland heeding the call to evacuated as Hurricane Ian inches close. Ian is expected to make landfall in Florida in the next thirty-six hours after battering west Cuba with one hundred and twenty-five miles per hour winds. The Florida Keys will fill up early edge of the storm this evening with high winds and heavy rains. President B said his administration has already sent aid to the region ahead of the storm. Residents are rushing to build sandbags and stock up on emergency supplies. Some shelves are already running bare. It also a scramble to a scramble for Tampa area’s hospitals starting airlifting patients out of the danger zone. The Tampa Airport is closed, the Fort Myers Airport will close this evening. The Orlando Airport which rarely shuts down will cease operation tomorrow. Even Disney World will shut down their parks Wednesday and Thursday because of the storm.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 09.26.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.26.22/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Sep 2022 17:45:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.26.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, mandatory evacuation orders are already underway for hundreds of thousands of Florida residents as hurricane Ian gained strength as it bears down state’s west coast. Residents are filling up sandbags and waking to grocery stores clearing the entire inventory of bottled water and other non-perishable food items. Outside gas stations long lines of cars wrapped around the block as residents waited for fuel for their vehicles and generators ahead of expected power outages. Tonight, Ian is nearing the western tip of Cuba as a strong category 2 storm with one hundred mile per hour winds. It’s expected to grow in intensity to a category 4 storm with top winds of 140 miles per hour as it moves into the open waters of in the Gulf of Mexico. Governor R.D has declared a state of emergency for the entire state and the city of Tampa is bracing for its first major hurricane than more a century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even it doesn’t make a landfall here in Clearwater, meteorologists are expecting a powerful storm surge. Florida officials are sounding the alarms, ordering evacuations for nearly half million residents in low lying areas of Hillsborough and Pinellas counties. Today, hurricane Ian lashed the Cayman Islands with eighty-five miles per hour winds. It’s expected to intensified rapidly over warm waters as it approaches the Florida coast, bringing a storm surge up to ten feet. Governor R.D has already declared a state of emergency. In Clearwater, residents are stocking up on plywood and water. At one of several sandbag sites, it was bring your own shovel. Farther north, a weakened Fiona still packed a punch as extreme storm surge tore apart homes on Canada’s East Coast on Saturday. Back in Florida, residents are already finding some essentials hard to find.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 09.23.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.23.22/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Sep 2022 20:59:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.23.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, forecasters are keeping close eyes on two major storm systems. One bearing down Canada, the other could cost significant damage to the Gulf Coast and Florida. Hurricane Fiona is moving north towards Canada after hitting Bermuda earlier today, with heavy rains and winds. The damage was far more devastating though in Puerto Rico where nearly one million homes and businesses remain without power just five days after Fiona cost catastrophic flooding. The hurricane is currently a category three and it’s expected to make landfall in Nova Scotia by tomorrow morning. Forecasters here in the US are concerned about a storm in Caribbean, tropical depression nine. It could become a major hurricane that’s on track to hit Florida next week. The governor there declaring a state of emergency in preparation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fiona barreled its way from the Caribbean to the Atlantic. Tonight, it is gaining speed as it churns its way north off the East Coast, triggering dangerous conditions including heavy rains all along the way. Fiona isn’t finished just yet. The storm battered the Bermuda today with howling winds and driving rains knocking out the power to thousands. At least seven deaths have been attributed to the storm. More than half in Puerto Rico where Fiona got its start earlier this week is still without power. More than a quarter of the island has no water. There are debris, blocked roads and mud-caked homes. With Puerto Rico fresh on their minds, Floridians are taking no chances as a new storm gathering in the Caribbean threatens to hit sometimes next week. And as Fiona barrels northward, residents along the Canadian coasts are preparing to for it to hit them hard next day. Canada maybe getting the brunt of this storm along the east coast. Fiona will be kicking up life-threatening surf and rip current conditions all throughout the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 09.24.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.24.22/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Sep 2022 20:59:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.24.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin with breaking news on two fronts. Today, a state of emergency in Florida was widen as the second named storm of the season takes aim. Ian expected to be a major threat to the US mainland. But we begin in Atlantic Canada. Today, what was Hurricane Fiona roared through five provinces with drenching rains and powerful winds. In some places, waves took buildings off their foundations. It is the first time in forty years a storm this strong has hit this far north.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Powerful winds are still ripping through the Atlantic provinces as this storm pushes north. Fiona landed here in the wee hours of the morning and knocked out power to thousands of people in five provinces. It could be days before that power is restored. There are trees down and power lines down throughout, in some cases, on top of people’s homes. There’s also widespread flooding and coastal surges historic surges on the west coast of newfoundland. It’s so bad that some homes were washed out to sea. Now emergency officials are telling us that it could be days, maybe weeks before this region recovers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fiona has left a week of destruction in its wake. Puerto Rico was hit Sunday and it is still recovering. Half the island remains without power. Fiona has killed at least eight people. And today, people in Florida are stocking up on supplies as they prepare for Ian.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 09.25.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.25.22/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Sep 2022 20:10:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.25.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin with Ian. It is the nineth named storm in the Atlantic and now, the biggest threat to Florida so far this hurricane season. Ian is barreling towards Cuba. This video showing heavy rain from the storm was shared by a CBSN producer. Ian is rapidly intensifying. People in Florida are no strangers to this type of weather, are being urged to get ready. Today near Tampa, people fill sandbags, others raced to buy essential supplies. Governor R.D declared this a statewide emergency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ian is very likely to strengthen rapidly over the next couple of days. Don’t let its current intensity and appearance on satellite fool you. This is going to look a lot different tomorrow and into the middle part of this coming week. Now, we already know that this is going to be coming into the Eastern Golf of Mexico as a strong hurricane. What we don’t know is exactly where the center is going to make landfall. But the entire Florida Peninsula and Florida Panhandle regions need to be ready for impacts. We’ve already got a tropical watch up for the lower Florida Keys, from the 7-mile down to Key West. And after that, conditions will be going downhill from South to North mainly starting on Wednesday and going North from there. We could have major impact even without a major hurricane in the wind scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Floridians prepare for Ian, Canadians and the Atlantic Coast are reeling from Fiona’s fury. Officials called the scope of the damage there unprecedented. Tonight, hundreds of thousands remain without power. Soldiers have been called in to help with cleanup efforts.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 09.22.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.22.22/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Sep 2022 20:29:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.22.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, the federal investigation into the top secret documents seized from D.T’s Florida home has resumed. The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of the Justice Department and criticized the former president’s argument that the document had been declassified. But in his first interview since the FBI search, the former president doubled down on that claim saying just by thinking about it, he could declassify documents. Also new tonight, the wife of Supreme Court Justice C.T, G, agreed to an interview with the House Panel investigating the January 6th attack on the Capitol. The committee wants to speak with T about her possible efforts to help overturned the 2020 election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CBSN has learned that the Justice Department has resumed its investigation of those records seized from Mar-a-Lago as the number of investigations. And the former president’s legal peril continues to grow. The latest in a series of setbacks for the former President T. The three-judge appeals court panel in a unanimous ruling repudiated federal judge A.C’s decision to freeze the investigation. The 11th Circuit saying C’s court abused its discretion and that the public has a strong interest in ensuring that storage of the classified records did not result in exceptionally grave damage to the national security. The judges also said T offered no proof to his claims he declassified the records and called the issue red herring. That even if T had declassified the records, the documents would not belong to him. Meanwhile, the special master in the Mar-a-Lago case today said T’s lawyers have until the end of month to raise any disputes about the items seized including whether they believe the FBI lied about what was taken. The former president has claimed the government planted documents that weren’t actually there.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 09.21.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.21.22/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Sep 2022 19:32:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.21.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with the biggest escalation in the war in Ukraine since the invasion itself. Russia’s V.P is threatening nuclear war and warning the west he is not bluffing. It comes as humiliating defeats on the battlefield in Ukraine, and in it move not seen in Russia since World War II, P is calling up hundreds of thousands of reservists. The announcement was met by intense antiwar protesters across Russia with more than thirteen hundred arrests. In another sign of just how unpopular the war has become, one-way flights leaving Russia are selling out. Prices are skyrocketing as people try to flee that country. President B condemned P in his speech before the United Nation’s General Assembly. He accused Russia of violating the core principles of UN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As many as three hundred thousand Russians face the draft. Those with medical expertise are being conscripted with immediate effect. P’s back is against the wall and he is playing dirty. A sore loser, but a dangerous one, upping the ante by threatening to use nuclear weapons. Both sides are losing men. Today, Russia’s Minister of Defense says nearly six thousand of their soldiers have been killed but according to estimates from the US, Russian casualties are closer to eighty thousand. P is so desperate, he has been reduced to recruiting convicts. The head of the mercenary group, W, was filmed in a prison, offering freedom in exchange for fighting on the frontline. But it’s not going down well at home, resistance to the draft has sparked demonstrations in several cities including Moscow and St. Petersburg. Over twelve hundred protesters have been arrested. As P’s desperation grows, Ukraine’s resolve hardens. They’re not stopping now, fighting with their hearts. P plans on holding referendums in territories seized just east of here, to force through a vote to become part of Russia. This sets the stage for him to claim and attack on any of those regions is insult on Russia.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 09.20.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.20.22/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Sep 2022 19:44:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.20.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, hurricane Fiona is only getting stronger as it moves through the Caribbean as a Category three storm, with sustain winds of more than one hundred and fifteen miles per hour. The first major hurricane slammed the Turks and Caicos this earlier today after devastating Puerto Rico with nearly three feet of rain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re about to hear the governor make a bold prediction when he thinks most people could have power restored. We met the governor here today in Salinas right along the Southern Coast, which was overrun by not only rainwater, but ocean water. The most water has receded. And what we have left tonight is mud, debris and Puerto Ricans with a lost storm-driven PTSD. It has been one day since hurricane Fiona’s fierce winds and torrential rain finally left Puerto Rico. And people are now just beginning to grapple with widespread damage and no power. We flew to La Paz, on Puerto Rico’s southwestern edge. To the East of La Paz in Salinas, we caught up with Puerto Rico’s Governor, P.P who predicted the power outage is going to be on soon. A substantial majority of the customers will get their power back by the end of the day tomorrow. Near where the governor surveyed damaged, one farmer in Salinas called this catastrophe in twenty years. Plantains, bananas, all underwater, ruined. Evidence of Fiona’s path is everywhere. And across the island, homes and businesses are destroyed, five years after Hurricane Maria killed nearly three thousand people and knocked out power to 1.5 million residences. Now a good portion of the island is in the dark again. Critical update to the island’s power grid since Maria are continuing.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 09.19.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.19.22/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Sep 2022 18:15:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.19.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We are here outside Westminster Abbey. This is a church that is a thousand years old and has held &lt;strong&gt;coronations&lt;/strong&gt;, royal weddings and today, the funeral of her majesty, Queen E the II. The other big story we are covering tonight is what’s happening in Porto Rico there has been devastating damage cause by Hurricane Fiona. Here in London, the State Funeral steeped in centuries of tradition and viewed by billions around the world. King Charles the III and other members of the royal families getting emotional during solemn processions to the Queen’s final resting place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tens of thousands of people gathered here at Windsor to watch a funeral on the big screens and then to await the arrival of the Queen herself. And when it ended, there was two-minute moment of silence here and across the nation, a &lt;strong&gt;poignant&lt;/strong&gt; end to an historic moment. And so, it ends with this spectacular send off no nation could ever rival. Queen E’s seventy years reign came to a close with splendor and sadness. The coffin carried from Westminster Hall to Westminster Abbey where world leaders had already arrived. President B, one of handful of those allowed to make their own way but assigned a seat fourteen rows back. In a day so packed with symbolism, one symbol was missing as the coffin left the Abbey came a salute from Prince W and other senior royals in which Prince H could not partake in civilian dress as a non-working royal. The funeral cortege moved up toward the mall at Buckingham Palace where she had witnessed so many events including her Jubilee this summer. Now, witness to the Queen’s final act. At the edge of Royal London, the Queen’s family including young Prince G and Princess C watched solemnly as the coffin was loaded into a hearse.&lt;/p&gt;

The entire island of Utuado in Porto Rico is without electricity after being hit by hurricane Fiona. The damage is devastating. But we begin with world leaders gathering in London for the State Funeral of Queen E the II. Today, President B and the First Lady J.B visited West Minster Hall where the formal monarch is lying in state. Later, he signed a book of condolences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the final touches are being put on the Queen’s State Funeral as Great Britain and the world continued to mourn the late monarch. At the stroke of eight, a moment of silence in memory of the Queen. As millions across Britain paused to reflect on the only monarch most had ever know upon till her death. At Buckingham Palace, King C and C, the Queen Consort hosted a state reception like no other before it. Hundreds of dignitaries from around the worlds including President B along with other Presidents, Prime Ministers, Emperors, Kings, Queens and Sultans representing nearly two hundred countries and territories gathered to honor the Queen. While mourners continue to line up for hours to see the late monarch’s coffin in the West Minster Hall. The last viewing will be by 6:30 in the morning on Monday, the day of her State Funeral. Hundreds of soldiers have already taken part in funeral, rehearsals in what’s expected to be a &lt;strong&gt;regal&lt;/strong&gt; and yet deeply personal memorial. As many as two million people can fill the streets of London to watch the procession and ten thousand police officers will take part in one of the largest ever security operations Britain has ever organized.

Today, about fifty migrants, many with young children arrived in the nation’s capital. It’s the latest move by the Republican-led states to transfer migrants unannounced across the country. More buses also arrived in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet another bus carrying migrants arrives here at the Port Authority, adding to more than eight thousand already in New York City shelter system. Meanwhile, Republican governors vow to send even more migrants to Democrats-led communities, from New York to DC to Chicago to California. Arriving by bus and plane in Northern California, dozens of families including children were dropped off without any direction. Aid workers say some migrants walk from the airport looking for shelter. They ended up sleeping in a park. New York shelters are at the breaking points. Mayor E.A says the city has opened twenty-three emergency shelters and is even considering using cruise ships as housing. Republican governors of border states say they won’t stop sending migrants to Democratic cities in an effort to provoke President B to act on border security. This morning, a bus from Texas dropped off migrants in Vice President’s neighborhood in Washington DC. And the governors of Texas and Florida say they are willing to use tax payers’ money for these buses and even flights. Texas has already spent twelve million dollars on transportation costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, a hurricane warning issued for Porto Rico as tropical storm Fiona powers up. It’s blamed for at least one death in the French Caribbean island of Guadeloupe.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 09.16.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.16.22/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Sep 2022 19:06:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.16.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;There are a number of developing stories as we come on the air. First, tropical storm Fiona is heading for Porto Rico and the US Virgin Islands bringing heavy rain. But we want to begin in Ukraine. Because today was significant for many reasons, the war has raged nearly seven months with Russia’s aggression devasting families and many parts of the global economy. And today, V.P was confronted directly. Indian Prime Minister M telling him, now is not the time for war. P replied, Moscow will do everything to try to stop this as soon as possible. Meanwhile, President B tell Sixty Minutes in an exclusive interview there will be consequences if Russia escalates the fighting further. The public pressure on P to stop comes as horrifying pictures emerged today from Izium, a city in a region of the country recently taken by Ukrainian forces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where Russia came to hide crimes. And these are the men and women determined to uncover them. The smell is overpowering, death on an industrial scale, and the work, overwhelming, exhausting for those on the scene. This one investigators say contain the remains at least seventeen Ukrainian fighters but mostly, we saw civilians. Investigators led by Kharkiv’s chief war crimes prosecutor exhumed fifty bodies today, some bearing the signs of torture. It was in Bucha that we first saw the brutality Russian troop was capable of. Now Izium, leaving no doubt that this is a war that’s been declared largely on civilians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To aid the Ukraine offensive, the B administration has announced a six hundred million dollars in military weapons in an exclusive interview this Sunday Sixty Minutes.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 09.15.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.15.22/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Sep 2022 19:11:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.15.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, the labor deal that prevented catastrophic railroad shutdown.

President B announced the deal after an all-night negotiating session. The deal avoids a shutdown of the nation’s freight trains and passenger traffic that could have devastated the already fragile economy less than two months before the midterm elections. Amtrak is scrambling to restore service after the company canceled all long-distance routes ahead of a possible work stoppage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some late-night nudging by the President and the meeting between union leaders and rail owners that was not allowed to end until they shook hands. Standing in the Rose Garden, President B hailed a deal to head off what would have been first rail strike since 1992. The agreement was the product of marathon. Twenty-hour talks led by Labor Secretary M.W. W says a strike would have cost the US economy two billion dollars a day. Twelve unions secured the largest wag increase for railroad workers in more than four decades. A raise of twenty four percent over five years. They also secured one more day of paid leave and for the first time, right to take unpaid leave to attend medical appointments. That victory so close to the deadline did come at a price. Amtrak had already canceled some long-distance trains and GM anticipated auto parts shortages prepping to close some plants. This standoff was a big test for a man who has frequently build himself as, quote “The most pro-union president ever”. And the test isn’t quite over yet. This deal still has to be voted by more than a hundred thousand rail workers. A series of votes will take place over the next few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 09.14.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.14.22/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Sep 2022 18:22:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.14.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, the general public begin saying its final goodbye to Queen E II in London. The late monarch will lay in state until her funeral on Monday. You can see mourners inside the Westminster Hall tonight, the Queen’s coffin surrounded by royal body guards. Hundreds of thousands are expected to pay their respect over the next four days. At one point, the line stretched nearly three miles. The bishop lead up a brief service this morning attended by King Charles and other members of the royal family. K, the princess of Wales wore the Queen’s jewelry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That behind me is part of a never-ending line of mourners winding their way to Westminster Hall across the bridge to visit the Queen lying in state. It’s been a day of pageantry, but also high emotions in quiet respect as we entering the one of the final legs of the Queen’s journey. From beneath the grand backdrop of Buckingham Palace, flanked by her Grenadier Guards. Queen E the II left home today for the final time. Her coffin carried on a horse drove carriage with the imperial state crown she wore placed on top. Thousands of mourners crowded the long avenue leaving from the palace, many stood in a solemn silence. The whole family was reunited at the Palace of Westminster where the Queen’s body will lie in state until her funeral on Monday. Hundreds of thousands of people are expected to visit the line leading to Westminster Hall already stretching back for miles. The only monarch most here has ever known, a woman devoted to duty nearly her entire life with one last duty to fulfill even after death. President B spoke by phone to King Charles today offering his condolences. President will attend the Queen’s funeral next week.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>cbsn09.13.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbsn09.13.22/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Sep 2022 19:08:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbsn09.13.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;As we come on the air, the coffin of Queen E is now at Buckingham Palace. It was an emotional return to the home as thousands lined the streets of London to catch a glimpse of the only monarch that many of other may have ever known. The late queen arrived at the palace for the final time, her official residence during her seventy-year-reign. The day began in Scotland as her coffin was carried from St. Giles Cathedral and driven to Edinburgh airport for her final journey home. Also arriving at Buckingham Palace tonight, Prince W and Princess K as well as Prince H and his wife M for a private family gathering. We take you to the Buckingham Palace in a moment but the first the big story here in the US, another disappointing report on inflation as prices unexpected rose in August and remain nearly a forty year high. The consumer price index for August was up 8.3% compared to one year ago as the cost of almost everything keeps going up. Wall Street reacted with a major sell-off with the DOW and S&amp;amp;P 500 suffering their worst day since June of 2020. The tech-heavy NASDAQ dropped more than 5%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today’s report dashed hopes that inflation had officially peaked and was on its way down. Instead, the prices of nearly all goods actually crept up, and wages can’t keep pace. Government figures confirmed what most consumers already sense, inflation isn’t easing. Groceries up 13.5% since last year, electricity up 15.8%, car repairs up 9.1%, rent up 6.7%. The bottom line according to Moody’s, the average household spending four hundred and sixty dollars more a month to buy the same goods and services as last year. That rate sent stocks tumbling today, the S&amp;amp;P sank by more than 4% as the markets brace for more interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve in bid to cool the economy. Typically, lower gas prices bring down the cost of other goods. But so far that hasn’t happened, even though the average price of a gallon of gas fell twenty six cents in the past month.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 09.12.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.12.22/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Sep 2022 20:07:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.12.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;As we come on the air, long lines of mourners are paying their respects to the late Queen. The monarch’s coffin with a five-hundred-year-old crown atop, is lying in rest at St Giles Cathedral in Edinburgh. Earlier, we witnessed solemn tradition, King Charles the III and his three siblings stood guard. And here at Buckingham Palace, we saw the first changing of the King’s guard in seventy years. It has been a busy day for the new King. He said today, he felt the weight of history but today you could almost see the weight of grief for a son who just lost his mother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crowds here were certainly dense, but the mood wasn’t sad so much as solemn and respectful. People are very aware that they are witness to an extraordinary historical turning point. The band struck up the anthem as Queen E left Holyrood House, her Edinburgh home one last time carried by soldiers from the Scottish regiment. The hearse bore her coffin to St. Giles Cathedral past silent crowds. The four children walking behind. Princess Anne, Prince Andrew and Edward and King Charles. Still in official mourning but already hard at work, Charles’s day had begun in London. In Westminster Hall, the room where his mother will lie in state later this week. He accepted the condolences of members of parliament and House of Lords. King Charles then flew to Scotland, and first with his wife Camila he met with his a few of his subjects. Then he addressed the Scottish politicians. In St. Giles Cathedral, a service of Thanksgiving for Queen E life began as the oldest crown in the British Isles, the Crown of Scotland was placed on her coffin. Outside, thousands of people waited patiently inline for their chance to file inside and pay their respects.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 09.11.12</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.11.12/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Sep 2022 19:29:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.11.12/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, Queen E the II’s final journey begins after her coffin was driven through the Scottish countryside from her summer home at Balmoral Castel to Hollyrudehouse Palace to Edinburgh. Tens of thousand of mourners lined the roads to pay their respects to their beloved Queen, the longest serving monarch in British history. The Queen’s state funeral will take place next Monday will be the first in United Kingdom in more than half a century, when Winston Churchill was given the honor in 1965. As proclamation events were held across the kingdom, we were here at Buckingham Palace when King Charles the III arrived and appeared to become emotional as he was greeted by the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President B confirmed today he would attend Queen E’s funeral. Meanwhile, here at Scotland the elaborate prelude has begun. The Queen’s hearse left Balmoral, her private country estate, at 10:00 this morning. The coffin, draped in the Scottish Standard flag and bearing a wreath that included white weather and sweet peas, one of her favorites. The procession wound its way through the Scottish countryside. Well-wishers lining the route on horseback and even in tractors to say goodbye. Meanwhile, in the Scottish capital Edinburgh, preparations were underway for the proclamation to officially recognize her son as the new King in Scotland. By late afternoon, crowds packed the street of the capital to pay their respects to E. She will spend two nights here, among people connected to her as their sovereign and their countrywoman. Queen E was descended from Scottish Kings. Tomorrow afternoon, the Queen’s body will be brought to St. Giles Cathedral behind me for a religious service and also to allow members of the public to file past the coffin.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 09.10.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.10.22/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Sep 2022 18:57:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.10.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Buckingham Palace made it official tonight. Queen E’s funeral will be held Monday on Westminster Abbey in London. This is the scene today outside Balmoral Castel in Scotland where the Queen died Thursday. Tomorrow, her coffin will be taken to Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh. The casket accompanied by their only daughter, Princess A. At five hundred miles south, this remarkable reunion today, Prince W and H greeting outside Windsor Castel, they were joined by their wives, K, now the Princess of Wales and M, Duchess of Sussex. This historic day began with a nearly a thousand-year-old tradition, formally named Charles as King.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charles automatically became the new monarch when the Queen died two days ago. But his role was officially announced across the country today. In a solemn ceremony steeped in centuries of tradition, King Charles the III was officially declared the United Kingdom’s new monarch. Before a council of advisors, including six former prime ministers, the King pledged to carry on his late mother’s legacy. The Queen E was proclaimed monarch seven decades ago, some of the formalities were filmed. On Saturday for the first time, the entire process was broadcast live on TV. But it was also read out to the public at St. James’s Palace. And in the ancient commercial center of London, the way people used to learn the identity of their new sovereign. And it’s already echoing in the other fourteen commonwealth realms, including Canada, where Charles is King. The seventy-three-year-old was Britain’s longest serving heir to the throne. And most Brits know only mother as monarch.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening 09.09.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-09.09.22/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Sep 2022 17:24:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-09.09.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Today, the commonwealth heard from its new sovereign. King Charles III addressed a grieving nation and the world for the first time as King, promising to carry up his mother’s life long service to British people. King Charles and Camila, the new Queen consort arrived at Buckingham Palace greeted by thousands of people. And at military sites across the United Kingdom, cannon fire rang out in a ninety-six-gun salute, one round for each year of the Queen’s life. The first King speech was an intensely personal message. King Charles flew back from Balmoral Castel in Scotland, making his way to Buckingham Palace. And when the King and the Queen Consort Camila got out their car. They received the kind of warm welcome that conveyed the crowds here were not just gathered to bid farewell to their beloved queen, but to greet their new King. The day ended with a solemn remembrance service at St. Paul’s Cathedral and that emotional speech that nearly brought the new King to tears.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 09.08.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.08.22/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Sep 2022 21:07:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.08.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The world is mourning Queen Elizabeth II who died this afternoon at age ninety-six. Surrounded by family at her summer home in Scotland. Earlier in the day, the Buckingham Palace announced that Her Majesty who ruled over the Commonwealth for a record seventy years was put on a medical supervision. Her doctors were concerned about her health, family rushed to her side. In accordance with the royal line of succession, her oldest son Charles immediately became King which put her grandson Price William next in the line to the throne followed by William’s eldest son nine-year-old Prince George. Just before her death was announced, a double rainbow appeared Buckingham Palace as the crowd gathered. President B visited British Embassy in Washington late today and left a message in condolence book. In the statement he said quote “Queen Elizabeth was a stateswoman of unmatched dignity and constancy who deepened the bedrock alliance between United Kingdom and the United States.”&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 09.07.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.07.22/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Sep 2022 21:44:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.07.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, wildfires are leaving a trail of destruction at a record-breaking heat in the west. The California heat wave is stretching its eight straight days with seven states under warnings and advisories. The temperatures are record breaking. Salt Lake City and Fresno, California had their hottest September days ever. The brutal heat is straining California’s power grid and power companies are pleading with public to conserve energy. The governor there sending out rare text alerts to avoid rolling blackouts. The dry weather has caused more than a dozen wildfires to explode across the state. Sheriffs and deputies are going door to door to warn those who haven’t evacuated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another brutal day for California. Withering heat and worsening wildfires, this one near Hemet, now more than seven thousand acres and growing in all directions. We are also learning more tonight about two residents who died as flames roared into their neighborhood. In the Southern California mountains, another wildfire exploding in size. All this as California oppressive heat wave continues to shatter records. Downtown Sacramento on Tuesday hit one hundred sixteen degrees, it’s hottest day ever. Demand on the state’s power grid also hit all-time high prompting this emergency alert. It may have worked. State officials reported a significant drop in energy use. But the threat of rolling blackouts remains. In Hemet, where at least seven buildings were destroyed, evacuees wonder what’s next. Parts of California could experience this extreme heat through Friday, that’s when relief could finally come in the form of rain from a hurricane no less headed north from Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 09.06.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.06.22/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Sep 2022 15:48:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.06.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, extreme weather from coast to coast. Torrential rains and flooding in the Northeast to record heat and deadly wildfires in the west. More than fifty-eight million people are under excessive heat warnings and advisories in seven states. Multiple wildfires are burning outside California as firefighters battled the flames along with brutal heat. Temperatures have topped century mark for the seventh straight day with the state capital of Sacramento expected to reach a hundred and fifteen degrees this afternoon. In the northeast, it’s rain and floodwaters causing the biggest problems. Two straight days of storms dropped nearly a foot in parts of Rhode Island, while downpours as far south as Philadelphia have flooded roads and left drivers stranded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, firefighters are trying to steer this fire around the community. There used to be a home here and the family lived here say they barely had enough time to escape the flames. Others weren’t so lucky because this fire just moved so fast. It’s what firefighters feared the most, record setting heat, parched land and wildfires exploding in size. It moved too fast to evacuate everyone safely. The community only has one way in or out. Fire officials say the wind direction completely shifted. And another fire near the Oregon border left this entire neighborhood in ruins. Throughout the state, California continues to endure its worst and longest heatwaves in years. On Monday, an all-time high of one hundred and seventeen degrees in the San Francisco Bay area, record breakers that are straining the power grid to the breaking point. And the heat is more than just inconvenience. Last year, more Americans died from extreme heat than from any other hazard, far more than floods, tornadoes, hurricanes or extreme cold. California just now is entering what is normally the worst part of its fire season.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 09.05.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.05.22/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Sep 2022 15:48:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.05.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, severe weather is in the forecast for nearly a third of the nation from record heatwaves in the West, floods across the Midwest and South. Right now, a line of storms is moving through the East with heavy rains, thunderstorms and tornado warnings. Flash flooding has closed roadways and stranded drivers in parts of Rhode Island and Massachusetts. In California, temperatures hit triple digits for the sixth straight day as thousands flocked to the beach to beat the hit. Record temperatures have also fueled deadly and destructive wildfires in northern California. The governor there declared a state of emergency in two counties after roads were washed away. As of this as travelers make their way back home following this holiday weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As hot as it is here, it’s about twenty degrees cooler than many inland cities where for some the hot heat is a health risk. There is no relief from California’s worst heatwave in years. For six days, Californians have been told to power down on electricity in air conditioning. The power grid is close to reaching maximum demand, meaning potential blackouts. The warning of residents, conserve or else. The unrelenting heat is shattering records. Ninety-seven degrees in Newport Beach on Sunday and all time hot one hundred and nine in Long Beach, and one hundred and seven near Disneyland. In northern California, fast moving wildfires destroyed more than one hundred homes near the Oregon border not all evacuated in time. The women ages sixty-six and seventy-three were founded by first responders. And as the West bakes, intense floods hit parts of the South. To avoid getting heatstroke, hydration is key. Experts say if you’re feeling really thirsty, you’re already dehydrated. So, you need to keep drinking water consistently throughout the day. Excessive heat warnings are effect here through Wednesday night.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 09.04.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.04.22/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Sep 2022 20:51:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.04.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with weather extreme from coast to coast. In Georgia, states of emergency have been declared in two counties. They were swamped by flash flooding, after more than a foot of rain fell in the last twenty-four hours. And Indiana, at least one person is dead tonight, after rushing water caused widespread devastation. While in the west, there are several cities enduring triple-digit temperatures and a severe September heatwave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extreme heat is punishing the West for the fifth straight day. And California are being asked to conserve and to brace for blackouts. Packed beaches, strained power grids, and a rush to get people and pets out of triple digits temperatures. Big parts of the West are in the grip of a brutal heatwave. Fueled by extreme heat and drought, the Cedar Creek Fire in Oregon is just one of the eighty-five wildfires burning in the US. More than twelve thousand fire personnel are on the frontlines. In northern California, the Mill fire has expanded to more than four thousand acres and destroyed a hundred structures. California is in the fifth day of record-breaking heat. Power grids are stresses, and cities like Glendale are preparing for rolling blackouts. In Death Valley, one of the hottest spots on the planet, weather extremes. Last month, this desert was hit by historical flash flooding. None of these weather events can stop tourists from snapping pictures in front of a giant thermometer. California’s power supplies will be put to the test every day until this heatwave breaks. It’s already moving closer to capacity.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 09.03.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.03.22/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Sep 2022 20:01:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.03.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin with danger above, a stolen plane ominously circling the sky above northeast in Mississippi for hours. At the controls, a man police say threaten to crush into a Walmart. The twin engine aircraft lifted off from a regional airport in Tupelo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suspect could face making terrorist threat and grant ??? charges after police say he stolen the plane from this regional airport. Authorities believe he had some flight instruction, but not enough experienced to land a plane. Today, terror in Tupelo, Mississippi. A plane police say was stolen circled over homes and businesses in the small city. Authorities say the man at the control said he intended to crush to a Walmart, that forced evacuation of the area. Police say P was employed by an aircraft maintain company at Tupelo regional airport. He took off a twin-engine aircraft when air traffic controllers were not on duty. After about five hours in the air, P landed in a field roughly forty miles north of Tupelo, uninjured. Now the FAA says it will investigate this incident, meanwhile local police say P could face federal charges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight, nearly fifty Americans are under alerts because of blistering heat waves that are breaking records across the west. It’s also fueling wildfires including these flames that cause injures and prompt evacuations in California.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 09.02.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.02.22/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Sep 2022 19:23:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.02.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, the Labor Day travel rush is in full swing as Americans take to the road and the skies for one final gateway of the summer. AAA expects it to be the busiest travel Labor Day travel weekend in three years, bouncing back to pre-pandemic levels. The national average for a gallon of gas is now $3.81. That’s down $1.21 from the peak in June. Airports are also crowded with passengers after a frustrating summer since Memorial Day, nearly forty-eight thousand US flights have been canceled and nearly five hundred thousand were delayed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The airports are busy. In the last two days, the TSA has screened more passengers they did during the same period back in 2019. The airline say they are ready for the crowd but everyone is watching the weather. Summer storms have been at the heart of so many of the travel disruptions. Millions are flying this Labor Day weekend as a summer of struggles comes to a close for the nation’s airlines. Severe summer weather and staffing shortages led to a spike in cancelations and delays. Nearly one in four US flights has been late this summer, on average, by nearly an hour. Travel disruptions sent passenger complaints soaring in June, up two hundred and seventy percent from the same time in 2019. Transportation Secretary P.B isn’t ruling out new regulations. But most travelers will be driving. Gas prices have dropped eleven consecutive weeks but are still about twenty percent higher than last Labor Day. Still, inflation is making everyone’s gateway cost more besides gas prices being up, airfares are about twenty percent higher, rental cars, hotels, food and entertainment all noticeably more expensive than they were before the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 09.01.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.01.22/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Sep 2022 19:28:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-09.01.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, day four of the humanitarian water crisis in Jackson, Mississippi as frustrations grow for the nearly two hundred thousand Americans living without clean drinking water. Officials reported progress in repairing the city’s water treatment plant, but even as the water pressure returns, the state capital and its surrounding communities can’t drink that water. Some six hundred national guards, troops are on the scene helping the city and volunteer groups get drinking water into the hands of residents. Thousands are lining up in the ninety-degree heat. Jackson population which is more than eighty percent black has been under a boil water notice for more than a month. And all Jackson’s public school district students are learning remotely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s extremely difficult and there was on timeline for relief. Families don’t even have clean water to take showers or even brush their teeth. So, they are coming here to one of seven new large distribution sites. After nearly a week, many in Jackson Mississippi are still without reliable drinking water. Despite crews installing an emergency pump at the city’s deteriorating water treatment facility a day ago. Today, the Mississippi governor deflected questions about why it’s taken so long to solve a crisis that was a long time coming. Today, the National Guard set up additional sites to hand out bottle water by the case. Until the problem is solved, people will continue to be desperate to get water. Now, the National Guard tells CBSN it will remain here in Jackson until order has changed.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 08.30.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.30.22/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Sep 2022 20:05:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.30.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;A humanitarian crisis is unfolding here at a major city in America as state of emergency is declared in Jackson, Mississippi. The governor warning the capital with nearly two hundred thousand residents to not drink the water. The national guard has been called in to help get bottle water to those in need. And it’s not just drinking water, low water pressure means people are unable to shower or flush their toilets. The problem at the water treatment plant came after days of heavy rains resulted in a swollen Pearl River. And tonight, one of the most alarming parts of this story, schools are now impacted and officials say they don’t know how long the crisis will last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight, it is almost every family for themselves in the search for water. There is nothing in the stores and the water giveaway across this city, they are running out. A line stretching as far as the eye can see of people in Jackson, Mississippi tonight waiting for water that’s safe to drink. The irony of it, too much water along Jackson’s Pearl River after a storm contributed to the collapse of the city’s aging water system. Now, there is a state of emergency affecting as many as one hundred eighty thousand people. Emergency screws have been scrambling to get the water treatment plant back online. Floodwaters overran the pumps. Desperate residents now on the hunt for water to drink and cook with. The water system in the state’s largest city has been in crisis for years. Jackson has been under a boil water advisory for a month, and when an entire month without clean water last year.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 08.31.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.31.22/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Sep 2022 18:39:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.31.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We want to begin tonight with that extraordinary just before midnight filing from the Justice Department where the government laid out its investigation in far more detail than ever before. The document has thirty-six pages long with eighteen additional pages of attachments and includes this photo at the end of the filing, the final page showing several classified secrets and top-secret documents. One noteworthy point, none of the folders bear label or stamp indicating they have been declassified as T or his representatives have claimed. The Justice Department says even some of the FBI personnel and DOJ prosecutors on the case needed to get extra clearances to review some of that material. Now, in this filing, the government lays out an important timeline saying it tried to get these documents without a search warrant multiple times. They alleged D.T has pushed a quote” incomplete and inaccurate narrative” in the recent court filings, and that’s why we’re getting this new information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are certainly many new details here, stunning in how it shines a bright light in what was inside T’s home. And it gives us a new look into the scope of this high-profile investigation. The explosive legal document revealed for the first time ever photo evidence of some of the alleged highly classified documents seized from former President T’s Florida home. The redacted FBI photograph shows classified cover sheets, some with HCS marking, that refers to the intelligence derived from covert human sources. Some of the documents were found in T’s so called forty-five office at Mar-a-Lago, a location considered vulnerable by intelligence officials. The Justice Department has also laid out a case of possible obstruction of the probe by T and his lawyers, asserting they had evidence that government records were likely concealed and removed from the storage room and that efforts were likely taken to obstruct the government’s investigation. Back on June 3rd, 2 months before the search of Mar-a-Lago. T’s legal team told Justice Department officials that all sensitive documents have been returned. Responding today, T slammed the FBI’s handling of the search and claimed he declassified documents at his home. But in its filing, the government stated that T’s lawyer never asserted that T had declassified the documents or asserted any claim of executive privilege.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 08.29.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.29.22/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Aug 2022 19:55:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.29.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, top officials are beginning to assess whether intelligence was compromised as they reviewed the materials seized from former president’s Mar-a-Lago resort. The Justice Department believes some of those documents include intelligence gatherings and information derived from &lt;strong&gt;clandestine&lt;/strong&gt; human sources among America’s most closely-held secrets. And it comes as a federal judge is indicating she is open to appointing what’s called a special master, that’s a neutral party to examine those materials. A hearing on that is set on Thursday. So, this week is already proving to be a big one. But there are signs tonight that it may be too late as we are learning investigators have already gone through the material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight, the legal standoff over the documents taken from the property continues, and the former president continues to lash out at the FBI as he faces legal and political uncertainty. FBI investigators and agents reviewing the evidence gathered at former President T’s estate say they found a limited number of documents that could be covered by attorney client privilege. And sources close to T legal teams say that could bolster their push for an outside attorney or special master to be appointed to review the material. But the Florida federal judge overseeing the matter A.C, a T appointee, could also conclude that it is now unnecessary. Tomorrow, the Justice Department has a deadline to respond T’s request for a special master. Today’s filing indicates that they might review that as a necessary. A hearing on that matter will then be held on Thursday in West Palm Beach, Florida.&lt;/p&gt;

With artillery hitting uncomfortably close to nuclear reactors. The fate of Europe’s largest nuclear power plant is on the line as both Ukraine and Russia wrestle for its control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six months of Russia’s occupation has turned Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant into a deadly frontline. Reports of a new challenge come just two days after disconnected from the grid for the first time ever. For more than twenty four hours this week, Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant was operating on backup diesel generators. A constant electricity supply is critical for cooling down nuclear fuel and avoiding a disastrous meltdown. The nuclear power plant was captured by Russia in March. But it is still operated by Ukrainian technicians. At recent video from inside the plant shows Russian military vehicles parked near the reactors raising the risk of accidental fires. It’s been half a year since Russian unthinkable and invaded??? Ukraine. Presidential advisor Z.A says while they are graceful to all of military aides received, billions more is needed in heavy weapons to win this war. Six months on and this war is far from over with no clear end game insights.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 08.26.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.26.22/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Aug 2022 11:02:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.26.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, new details from the partially redacted affidavit used to authorize the FBI’s search of the former president D.T’s Florida home. One of the significant concerns according to the affidavit was that no space at T’s Mar-a-Lago home was authorized for the storage of classified material. Investigators using distinctly bureaucratic language said the records were unfoldered, intermixed with other materials and otherwise unproperly identified. Now as expected, the affidavit was heavily redacted, which thirty-seven percent of pages have no redactions. Thirty four percent the pages were partially redacted while twenty nine percent of this affidavit were totally redacted. In other words, completely blacked out. The affidavit argued the search of Mar-a-Lago was necessary due to the highly-sensitive material found in boxes covered by the National Archives back in January. Despite the heavy redactions, there are striking new details in this affidavit, it is outlined in gravely serious term as the Justice Department explains why it searched former President T’s Florida home eighteen days ago. The redacted affidavit reveals that of the fifteen boxes of the government records D.T brought with him to Mar-A-Lago, and ultimately returned to the Archives in January, fourteen had classified documents, some including sensitive information derived from government informants, critical to US intelligence gathering. In total, investigators found one hundred and eighty four documents with classification markings, including sixty seven documents marked as confidential, ninety two marked as secret, and twenty five marked as top secret. The documents labeled HCS refereeing to human confidential sources stood out to former CIA Director M.M. The affidavit underscores the alarm about the possible vulnerability of T’s waterfront property. A Secret Service source tells CBSN that it is a private club with protection limited background checks. The affidavit goes on to provide a glimpse into the Justice Department sources, and who might have witnessed potential criminal activities at Mar-A-Lago, noting the Department spoke to a significant number of civilian witnesses in order to protect them from intimidation or from publicly outed, the former federal judge and federal prosecutors agreed on the extent of redactions. The FBI agents who wrote the affidavit said there was probable cause to believe there was that evidence of obstruction will be found at T’s property, as well as contraband, fruits of crime or other items illegally possessed. T and his republican allies remain frustrated with the search and with the Justice Department. His spokesman today saying the affidavit was overtly political. And tonight, sources tell CBSN that some members of the intelligence community will soon begin assessing whether their sources were compromised based on what this investigation has revealed so far.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 08.25.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.25.22/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Aug 2022 10:59:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.25.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, we are one step closer seeing a redacted version of the affidavit that the government used to support a search warrant of former President T’s Florida home Mar-a-Lago. That release could come any moment. A federal ordered the unsealing hours after the Justice Department submitted the document with redactions. There are parts of the affidavit that federal investigators want to keep secret, citing concerns that it will impact the early stage of this probe. The redactions are expected to be extensive. Media organization including CBSN urge the release of document, something that would be extremely rare but would shed light on why the FBI searched a former president’s home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision by a Florida federal judge to release a redacted version of this affidavit is a major development in this case. And it could provide new details about why the home of the former president was searched. Late this afternoon, a federal judge B.R who initially approved the warrant that led to the search of Mar-a-Lago, issued an order that portions of the affidavit justifying the search should be made public by noon tomorrow. R wrote that he approved to the Justice Department’s suggested redactions to portions of the affidavit to protect the identities of witnesses, law enforcement agents, investigation strategy, direction, scope, sources and methods and grand jury information. Justice Department officials had opposed releasing the full affidavit and could still appeal the decision saying last week they are very concerned about the safety of the witnesses involved in their investigation of T’s handling of classified information, some of which went up to the level of the top secret. Judge R made the ruling just hours after the Justice Department submitted the redacted affidavit at his request. Former President T, who has previously called for it to be released, conferred with his attorneys in Bedminster, New Jersey, today. This comes as the new reporting of the Washington Post shows that National Archives officials were urging T’s lawyers as far back as May of 2021, fifteen months before Mar-a-Lago search to return boxes of the documents they said that were missing, including letters from North Korea Leader K.JU and former President O and that former White House Counsel P.C knew T had stored documents in his residence and agreed they needed to be returned. And all this comes as new investigations of T in Georgia ramps up. Prosecutors say today, they want to hear more from members of T’s inner circle, including former White House chief of staff M.M.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 08.28.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.28.22/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Aug 2022 19:17:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.28.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with a developing story out of Ukraine. This video shows new attacks near Europe’s largest nuclear powerplant. Overnight fighting there is reported as intense and the plant has been repeatedly damaged by days of shelling. It is controlled by Russian forces but operated by Ukrainian engineers. International experts say the latest shelling underlies the risk of a nuclear catastrophe. Now to a political battle for control of Congress, CBSN poll out today shows Republicans heading into the fall still estimated to win control of the House this November. At the same time, President B’s job approval has been ticked up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The documents ordered by the judge in Florida Friday said the FBI found one hundred and eighty-four documents with classification markings. And more than two dozen marked top secret. A CBSN poll finds eighty five percent of Democrats but only twenty percent Republicans say the search of former president’s residents was about national security. And ninety percent of Republicans think it was a political attempt to damage T. Representative A.K is only two Republicans on the Jan.6th select committee. And of course, with only seventy days left until those midterm elections. We’ll have to see what if any impact this has on voter turnout.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 08.24.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.24.22/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Aug 2022 20:25:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.24.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, president offers relief for millions of Americans burdened with federal student loans. The President pledged to wipe away thousands dollars of college debt, and his administration is also proposing big changes to the repayment programs. The highly anticipated plan forgives up to twenty thousand dollars for individual borrowers following through on a campaign promise he made in 2020. The average US household with student debt owes nearly fifty-nine thousand. That’s more than forty-five million borrowers owe more than 1.7 trillion dollars in student loan. Republicans are calling it a handout, leader M.M describing it as student loan socialism. When the president made the announcement today, so many borrowers rushed to find out their load information that load providers were overwhelmed. The president says his plan will help quote “fix a badly broken system”. With today’s announcement, the government is forgiving ten thousand dollars in federal loans for anyone earning less than one hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars a year, twenty thousand for those with Pell Grants for low-income students. Anyone with federal undergraduate loans will have repayments capped at five percent of monthly income, and the pandemic pause for loan repayment will extend to the end of the year. While some progressives wanted full loan forgiveness, Republicans slammed president’s move. And tuition keep rising, in 1980s, average costs of private four-year college was roughly five thousand five hundred dollars annually. This last school year, it was thirty-seven thousand dollars.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 08.23.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.23.22/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Aug 2022 19:12:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.23.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, we are learning new information about the FBI search at former president’s Mar-a-Largo estate, giving us a glimpse of what kind of classified materials were allegedly kept for the 54th president’s Florida home. CBSN has previously reported that classified documents were found in boxes that National Archives got back in January. But the T team shared a letter from the archivists that has new details. Inside those fifteen boxes were documents marked as classified national security information including the highest level of classification. And some known as special access per materials. That means T took Florida, some of the most highly classified secrets in the government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stunning new details tonight from the National Archives about highly classified materials in former president T’s position now coming to light in an official document for the first time. A newly reviewed letter from National Archives to D.T’s legal team details the alarm inside federal agency about T’s possession of highly classified material. Specifically, among the boxes, T took with him to his Mar-a-Lago estate were over one hundred documents with classification markings, comprising more than seven hundred pages, some up to top secret. So far, US officials tell CBSN that the Justice Department has retrieved one hundred and fifty classified documents from the boxes T handed over to the National Archives earlier this year. And the New York Times reports that since federal agents reengage with T’s legal team this summer and then searched his home, that number has climbed to more than three hundred, containing documents from the CIA, the National Security Agency and the FBI. T, who is considering 2024 presidential run continues to attack the probe.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 08.22.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.22.22/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Aug 2022 20:16:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.22.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, millions of Americans in the southwest are under flood warnings after monsoon rain drenched communities across parts of six states, North Texas getting the worst of it. The Dallas area suffering from a-month-long drought was pummeled for the nine-inches. That’s the second heaviest rainfall in the city’s history. It was the equivalent of a summer worth of rain in one twenty-four period. Flood waters rushed through streets submerging vehicles. And we’re learning tonight a woman swept off a bridge and has died. Well, flood waters create nightmare on the ground, airlines are severely impacted with more than seven thousand flights in the US delayed or canceled. More than half of all the flights at Dallas airport today have been delayed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That rain fell overnight into today and it prompted flush flooding like you could see right here. Late today, emergency crews rescue families with children in heavily flooded Seagoville, Texas while rains and flash floodings submerge houses, cars and even trapping drivers in and around Dallas. Dallas fire rescuers responded to close two hundred vehicle-rescues in just twenty-four hours. Just a few weeks ago, triple digit temperatures and drought conditions were baking north Texas, drying up the trinity??? River in Dallas. But overnight, rain pounded the area filling up the river base. Out west in Utah Zion National Park, torrential rains turned hiking path treacherous, putting park goers at risk. Dallas county just declared this area a disaster. Now the flood waters are starting to recede, that’s good news.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 08.21.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.21.22/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Aug 2022 19:03:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.21.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, millions of Americans from Texas to Louisianan are under threat from flash flooding. Torrential rain as swamping drought-stricken land. Near Flagstaff, Arizona rushing water made the roads unpassable. And this week, there is more rounds of rains to come storms move East.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is still extremely dry here in Los Angeles, but across the west and southwest, there is a rush to clean up in the wake of powerful storms that left a muddy mess. Flush flooding in Moab, Utah, turned main street into a river overnight. The sudden &lt;strong&gt;deluge&lt;/strong&gt; left some businesses in three feet of water, cut off roads and prompted officials to urge everyone to stay inside. The powerful monsoon storms also caught hikers off guard in Utah Zion National Park where crews are still searching for a missing person. In New Mexico’s Carlsbad Caverns National Park. Heavy rain made roads impassable, leaving more than one hundred tourists stranded for hours. After unprecedented amount of rainfall in one of American driest region causing millions in damage, Death Valley National Park is back open. The downpours aren’t enough to ease the drought that nearly half the US is under including Colorado River. The water shortage is so severe that US officials have ordered mandatory use cuts in Arizona, Nevada and New Mexico. A Colorado River pipeline leak has also prompted a new water ban in parts of LA county already home to some of the toughest water restrictions in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s hot and dry in the northeast and northwest while big stretches of the desert southwest are getting soaked by rounds of monsoon rain. Tonight, millions of Americans from Arizona to New Mexico are under flood alerts. This is Scottsdale, where the drought-stricken landscape is now waterlogged. In Tucson, high water forced an evacuation of this school bus full of kids Friday. This all comes as potential tropical cyclone and rainmaker is &lt;strong&gt;churning&lt;/strong&gt; off the gulf coast of Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will finally see some much needed, moisture in some drought-stricken areas like Texas. We have tropical moisture that is going to streaming in as we head into the upcoming week where place just north of Dallas and extending over Texarkana and Shreveport could see anywhere from three or five inches of rain, potentially even more. All of this thanks to a couple of features at play. We have a stalled-out boundary and also some tropical moisture that is being steered directly into some these areas that desperately need the rain. The problem is we have been very dry. And when the rain starts to fall, it’s falling on very dry soil. So, we could see some of that initially start to run off and cause some flash flooding issues, both Monday and extending into Tuesday morning. But these are places like Dallas, Houston and Waco that desperately need the rain.&lt;/p&gt;

A senior defense official tells CBSN that the nearly eight hundred million dollars package is to help Ukrainian forces regain territory as the war nears its sixth month. Shelling around a key nuclear plant in Ukraine is drawing international concern. The UN secretary called today for a demilitarized zone around Europe’s largest nuclear power plant which first came under Russian control back in March.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That arms package can’t come quickly enough for field commanders that we’ve spoken to. And what’s already been supplied is making huge difference on the battlefield. But the main focus today has been rising tensions over that nuclear power plant. Tonight, the threat of a nuclear disaster at Europe’s largest nuclear power plant has just gone next level. Ukraine accusing Russia of preparing to stage a false flag incident today. Russia accusing Ukraine of trying to trigger an accident to the complex. Russian forces even ordered employee to stay home according to Ukraine’s state-run energy firm. The brinkmanship follows two weeks of intensive shelling both side trading artillery strikes and accusations. UN secretary general has called the attacks on the plant “suicide”. In an effort to show just how seriously Ukraine is taking the threat, emergency worker dressed head to toe in protective suits in the city of Zaporizhzhia, held nuclear disaster drills, scrubbing down volunteers posing as radiation expose victims. A stage-managed performance for the cameras maybe, but the risks are real.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 08.18.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.18.22/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Aug 2022 19:31:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.18.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, we are one step closer to seeing parts of the affidavit that convinced a federal judge to allow the FBI to search former president T’s Florida home. And now we know just which crimes T is under investigation for by Justice Department. But the DOJ says the criminal probe is in its, quote” very early stages”. Late this afternoon, a judge given investigator one week to file a redacted version for him to consider unsealing. And in other T legal woes, a former top executive at the T organization pleaded guilty today to evading taxes and agreed to testify against the company at an upcoming trial. There was a court action today from New York to Florida that could have wide-reaching implications for the former president. Federal Judge B.R found the Justice Department had not met the high threshold for showing the entire affidavit should remain sealed. And he ordered the immediate release of this procedural records that provide new insight into the possible crimes behind the Mar-a-Lago search, willful retention of national defense information, concealment or removal of government records, and obstruction of federal investigation. The judge agree with media organization including CBSN, that at least some part of affidavit that supported the search could be unsealed. Under today’s order, the Justice Department has one week to propose one information like to black out or redact from the affidavit, information that if made public, prosecutors believe would be a roadmap to the criminal probe, and would reveal identities of potential witnesses and the FBI agents involved. In earlier today, in a Manhattan court, the former chief financial officer of T organization pleaded guilty to not paying taxes on almost two million dollars in compensation.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 08.17.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.17.22/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Aug 2022 19:00:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.17.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, D.T’s former Vice President is speaking out for the first time since the search of Mar-a-Lago. And it comes as the Jan.6th committee is continuing its work. Well, tonight the panel may have a new witness. M.P says he would consider testifying if he is asked. You may recall, there was pressure campaign led by T for P to overturn the 2020 election and not certify the electoral votes in Congress. White House told the committee that when P didn’t comply, the former president called him a wimp and rioters called for his hanging. Well, P’s comments came as R.G spent his day under oath before a grand jury at Atlanta that’s investigating attempts to overturn the Presidential Election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Georgia investigation may pose the most imminent legal jeopardy for the former President. But it’s also the work of the Jan.6th committee and its political impact ahead of 2024. And now, that committee may have yet another star witness. Today’s remarks by former Vice President M.P were the closest he has come to saying he might testify before the Jan.6th committee. Even though the relationship between P and Mr. T is strained as a result of Jan.6th. P today did weigh in on last week’s search of Mar-a-Lago while asking fellow Republicans not to target the FBI agents. Currently, Mr. T is under legal scrutiny in the state of New York. And in Georgia, the Fulton county district attorney could be building a case against him. In that case, former President was recorded in a phone call to Georgia Secretary of State. But there is another battleground in yet another court room. This one involving yet another T’s ally South Carolina’s senator L.G who is appealing a judge’s decision that he also testify before this special grand jury in this court house just as R.G did today.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 08.16.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.16.22/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Aug 2022 19:00:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.16.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We want to begin tonight with severe water cuts that will impact tens of millions of Americans and puts a fine point on how dire the crisis is in America’s west. A mega drought is drying up the Colorado river and depleting the nation’s largest man-made reservoir, Lake Mead. Tonight, the federal government is forcing states to cut the amount of water they can draw from the Colorado river. And that means states will have to make critical decisions about how they use water. And here in Washington, President B signed what he hopes will help make an impact. A bill that includes three hundred and seventy-three billion dollars to fight climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here in California, more than ninety nine percent of the state is now battered by drought. And federal government is so concerned about this critical water source, it’s taking unprecedented actions. It’s a crisis on Colorado. The nation’s largest reservoirs are rapidly retreating. Iconic dams could stop producing power. Western states are being warned to drastically cut their water use. Today, the Interior Department a first ever tier two shortage on the river that provides water for forty million people in seven states. Arizona will lose twenty-one percent of its water, Nevada, eight percent. And the government is now threatening unprecedented cuts on all the states unless they start using less water. Climate change is making the west hotter and dryer. The worst drought in twelve hundred years and chronic overuse have drained Lake Mead and Lake Powell to about a quarter of capacity.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 08.15.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.15.22/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Aug 2022 19:12:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.15.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The Justice Department is asking a judge not to release the affidavit that contains key details about why the FBI searched former President T’s Florida’s mansion last week. Well, the DOJ says that releasing that document would be &lt;strong&gt;detrimental&lt;/strong&gt; to the quote “integrity of investigation”. This comes as members from both parties today are demanding more details and are asking the director of National Intelligence for a damage assessment following reports that documents labeled top secret were found in Mar-a-Lago. The former president is defiant tonight, calling the search an assault and accusing the FBI taking three of his passports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Law and enforcement sources confirmed to CBSN that as investigators examine the boxes of documents seized from Mar-a-Lago. They are trying to determine who had access to the documents and their origin. Today, former President T said FBI agents told his team during the search to “turn off the camera, and the FBI can take anything they want, my people were asked to stand outside”. Law enforcement sources tell CBSN some of the documents taken in the search may be so sensitive, they can only be read in a secure location with tight controls. And in many cases can be only declassified by the agency where they originated. CBSN has learned a T&amp;rsquo;s lawyer submitted a written declaration that all classified materials had been returned over back in June until investigators realized there were more, removing eleven sets of documents last week. House Judiciary Republicans fired off letters to the B administration today, urging them to save their records about the search warrant, while others in the GOP stresses caution. Tonight, the Justice Department says that it would oppose the unsealing of an affidavit supporting the search warrant in order to protect witnesses who have come forward and not deter others from testifying.&lt;/p&gt;

In Washington, workers placed fences and protective barriers at the FBI headquarters ahead of any possible protests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The threats warn for the potential of violence against all levels of law enforcement officials. The threats are mainly occurring online. And FBI officials are concerned about their agents and staff. A joint FBI and Homeland Security memo sent to law enforcement across the country warns growing threats against them including a threat to place a so-called dirty bomb in front of FBI headquarters and general calls for civil war and armed rebellion. The uptick follows a search to former president D.T’s Mar-a-Lago home. The memo stating, “The FBI and DHS have identified multiple articulated threats and calls for the targeted killing of judicial, law enforcement, and government officials associated with the Palm Beach search”. That’s alarming to former FBI agent, turned Pennsylvania Congressman B.F. The bulletin also cites last Thursday’s attempt on FBI Cincinnati field office where an armed suspect failed to breach the facility and then let authorities on a pursuit and prolonged standoff that ultimately ended in his death. Now the memo says statements made by public officials that incite violence could also drive threats. And there is growing concern as we head into midterm elections.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 08.13.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.13.22/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Aug 2022 20:16:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.13.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, we have new reporting on the government documents seized from former president D.T’s residence at Mar-A-Lago. CBSN has learned a lawyer of T certified in writing that all classified materials had been removed from Mar-A-Lago after a June 3rd meeting with Justice Department officials. But this summer, individuals familiar with where and how those wayward documents were being stored told investigators about their existing at the private residence. Democrats on Capitol Hill now want a classified briefing from the Director of National Intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sounds like something out of a spy novel. The Espionage Act, basically outlaws holding onto national security information that could potentially harm the US or help foreign adversaries without authorization and this investigation is unprecedented. CBSN has learned that one of former president T’s lawyers confirmed in writing in June that all classified documents had been removed from Mar-A-Lago. Yet a newly unsealed warrant reveals FBI agents removed twenty plus boxes and binders including eleven sets of highly classified documents, some marked top secrets and some only meant to be viewed in secure government areas. The warrant also revealed the FBI is investigating the former President for potentially violating the Espionage Act, mishandling classified documents and obstruction of justice. On Friday, T posted on social media, suggesting the documents were all declassified, saying the FBI “didn’t need to seize anything, they could have anytime they want it without playing politics and breaking into Mar-a-Lago”. Senate Judiciary Committee ranking C.G says the &lt;strong&gt;affidavit&lt;/strong&gt; used to obtained the warrant should be released. The affidavit is going to give us a closer look at the larger investigation. And if convicted, each violation of the Espionage Act is actually punishable by up to ten years in prison.&lt;/p&gt;

The records that reveal that the FBI recovered eleven sets of classified records that including some documents labeled top secret. The warrant also indicates that FBI is investigating T for potential violations of the Espionage Act. The warrant says the agents were told to look for signs that official records had been altered, destroyed or concealed. Sources tell CBSN that investigators initially issued a subpoenaed for the records back in the Spring. We’re also learning more about the suspect killed in yesterday’s attempted breach of an FBI field office in Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former President T didn’t fight the release of these documents. And after five days of tumultuous back and forth between the Justice Department and the former President. Today, we finally got a look, detailing what the FBI carried out of T’s residence in Florida. The court paper obtained by CBSN and unsealed today show the FBI seized more than twenty boxes, some containing classified documents marked top secret and above. And according to sources the material likely includes highly sensitive communication intercepts. The FBI also took handwritten notes, two photo binders, information about the President of France, and a document about pardoning of T ally R.S. The list of seized materials run three pages. A federal magistrate approved a warrant to search the former President’s home one week ago Friday. And on Monday morning, the FBI executed the search. The warrant seeks documents related to the national defense, a possible violation of the Espionage Act, mishandling classified information and also cities possible destruction of government property. J.B now a T critic, served as his national security advisor. The FBI was authorized to search T’s office and all storage rooms or areas in which boxes or documents could be stored, which included most of the seventeen-acre estate. Guest suites were off limits. In a statement, the former President said the documents seized were “declassified” and he would have provided them if asked. On Capitol Hill, the Republicans continue to voice concern about the FBI search.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 08.11.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.11.22/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Aug 2022 19:04:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.11.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, the Department of Justice is asking a federal court to unseal the warrant that the FBI used to search the Florida home of former President D.T. Agents were looking for classified documents that may have been illegally taken from the White House. We learned today that investigators first subpoenaed those records this Spring. Fifteen boxes of presidential records were removed by federal authorities earlier this year and returned to the National Archives. Today, Attorney General M.G said a federal court found probable cause to justify the warrant and called on a judge to make those details public. G, the nation’s top law enforcement official said that unusual disclosure would be appropriate because the former President is talking publicly about the search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was an extraordinary moment, an Attorney General who rarely goes before the cameras, speaking out about the Justice Department’s probe about a former President and the FBI search that has jolted the nation’s political scene. Attorney General M.G took ownership of the decision to search former President T’s Florida residence this week. He also announced Justice Department has asked a judge to unseal the search warrant, handed over to former President’s legal team earlier this week when federal agents arrived at T’s home. And the Attorney General asserted it was T who publicize the search. G’s move to unseal the warrant punctuated a politically and legally charged week, as supporters rallied behind the former President, who declare the FBI search part of a witch hunt against him. Left unsaid why exactly FBI agents were authorized to go in, and which documents they took from the residence. The search was part of an ongoing federal investigation into documents T took with him when he left the White House last year. CBSN has learned that former T’s advisors have been questioned in recent months about how the former President dealt with sensitive materials and national security documents during and after his presidency. CBSN confirmed today that this week’s FBI search was proceeded by a grand jury subpoenaed this Spring which led to a June meeting between investigators and T’s lawyers to discuss how documents were taken from the T White House.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 08.10.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.10.22/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Aug 2022 19:34:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.10.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with the latest news about former President D.T’s growing legal troubles. He was set to be questioned under oath today for a civil investigation by the state of New York into alleged fraud by the T’s organization. In Manhattan, the former President waved to the crowd on his way to deposition. He invoked his constitutional right against self-incrimination by pleading the fifth refusing to answer questions. All this comes just days after the FBI executed a search warrant on T’s home looking for documents that could contain classified information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A court crowd gathered in lower Manhattan earlier today beneath the skyscrapers to witness a moment in American history. A former President being deposed under oath by New York prosecutors. T. invoked his fifth amendment right against self-incrimination, a move he had once disparaged. T’s deposition is the latest chapter in a &lt;strong&gt;contentious&lt;/strong&gt; standoff with New York State Attorney General L.J who is investigating whether T’s real estate businesses inflated the value of his assets including his fifth avenue apartment. In a statement, T said “He took the fifth because he had to”. When your family, your company become the targets of an unfounded, politically motivated Witch Hunt, you have no choice”. The New York Attorney General’s office has said today they “will continue to pursue the facts and the law wherever they may lead. Our investigation continues”. This comes as new details emerged about the FBI search of T’s Mar-a-Lago home. Agents spent nine hours in the residence and searched an office. There are other T related investigations. A criminal inquiry by Manhattan district attorney into his businesses there, a Georgia probe into his efforts to overturn the state’s 2020 election results, and a federal grand jury hearing witness testimony about T’s activities related to the 2020 vote. T remains popular in Republican party. Supporters outside Mar-a-Lago are just one sign of that. The former President is now using FBI search to raise funds. The former President huddled with Republican allies at his residence in Bedminster, New Jersey last night. They urged him to get into 2024 presidential race soon.&lt;/p&gt;

What we’re learning about the investigation that’s focused on potential mishandling of what could be classified material. Sources tell CBSN the FBI was met by T’s attorneys along with the secret service agents. It is the first time that in American history that a search warrant has been issued on a former President. And given the political implications, approval came from the very highest levels of the Department of Justice. White House officials say President B had no prior knowledge of the search and current FBI director C.W was appointed by T five years ago. A T’s lawyer who’s at Mar-a-Lago yesterday told us FBI pretty much arrived in full force, with agents and personnel numbering more than thirty. They brough a box truck for document removal. The search, this lawyer told us, targeted three rooms, the former President’s bedroom, his office and the storage room. The FBI executed a search of Mar-A-Lago, T’s primary residence, around 10 AM Monday. Two sources told CBSN, the investigators seized boxes and paper documents but no electronics. The Secret Service maintain a constant presence at the former President’s home and facilitate the FBI’s entry. Authorities also opened T’s safe at least two of T’s lawyers were present during the search. The documents are believed to contain classified information. T and federal investigators had been in negotiations over the records and the FBI visited Mar-A-Lago in June. Mishandling classified materials is potentially criminal. Federal law requires presidential records to be turned over to National Archives. It’s not known what documents were taken by federal authorities Monday. The Justice Department has so far declined comment. The night fell Monday, pro-T protesters gathered outside Mar-a-Lago, more assembled there today. T was not home but released a statement alleging that he was a victim of a politicized Justice Department.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 08.08.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.08.22/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Aug 2022 19:21:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.08.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, we start off with some breaking news. The FBI has served a search warrant on former President D.T’s Mar-a-Lago home in Palm Beach, Florida. The former President released a statement saying his home was under siege and compared it to the Watergate break-in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is without precedent in American history. The former President of United States now subject to a search of his primary residence by the FBI. According to multiple sources, the FBI searched for documents related to the Presidential Records Act, a law that requires official records from the Presidency to be saved in the National Archives. Failure to comply, is potentially a violation of federal law. We do not know if which records, if any, the FBI found in the search or if they were classified. T was not at Mar-a-Lago at the time FBI raid but confirmed it in a statement. In that statement, T said “A large group of FBI agents” came to his Mar-a-Lago home. T also said in that statement “they broke into my safe” to be clear this is an FBI raid under power granted to it by a federal judge. T is also under investigation for numerous actions undertaken to overturn 2020 presidential election and events leading up to the Capitol riot in January 6th, 2021 days before T left the White House after losing the election to President J.B. In recent weeks, Attorney General M.G has said repeatedly and &lt;strong&gt;emphatically&lt;/strong&gt; that T would not be immune from investigation or prosecution if evidence of the crime warranted.&lt;/p&gt;

And naturally, it didn’t come easy. First, polarized senators pulled an all-nighter. They started debating Saturday and kept arguing before finally voting. Then late today, Vice President K.H casting the tiebreaker, Democrats passed the President’s economic agenda that have been left for dead. It’s a mix of climate change spending, lower healthcare cost and raise corporate taxes. Also today, the President left the White House for the first time in more than two weeks since he first tested positive for Covid. He’ll head tomorrow to tour Kentucky’s flood damage and said today he is feeling great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The President acknowledge that this bill requires compromises but it includes some of his top policy goals. The legislation now heads to the US House for vote there, expected later this week. After a marathon weekend session that started more than twenty-four hours ago and ended in a major legislative win for Democrats. The Vice President K.H delivered the tiebreaking vote to pass the climate healthcare and tax bill known as the “Inflation Reduction Act” through an evenly divided Senate. But the final vote didn’t come before eleventh hours negotiations over a key tax provision in the legislation. A fifteen percent minimum tax on large companies. Senate Democrats say the legislation which represents in historic investment in climate will lower energy cost providing tax credits to those who buy green and manufactures who build it. They also argue it will reduce healthcare costs, especially for seniors and allow Medicare to negotiate down high-priced prescription drugs.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 08.06.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.06.22/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Aug 2022 19:36:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.06.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, in Washington the Senate’s working in a rare weekend session and has started to vote on a sprawling climate and health care bill. It’s really a scaled down version of the Democrats Build Back Better Bill. Passing it would continue a week of wins President B has desperately needed red hot jobs numbers, cooling gas prices. Conservative Kansas voting down further abortion rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President has tested negative today following his rebound case. He is monitoring the developments from here. Senators are expected to pull an all nightery and could have this wrapped up by Monday. And what would be a major legislative victory for Democrats. Senators scrambled into a rare Saturday session, gearing up for a weekend of debate on Democrats breakthrough Budget Bill that they say will lower energy and healthcare costs. Titled “The Inflation Reduction Act” and touted as the largest single investment in climate in US history. The bill would provide new incentives to invest clean energy and separately negotiate down prescription drugs. Democrats argue it would also reduce the federal deficit, raising revenue through tax provisions, including increased enforcement and a fifteen percent minimum tax to large companies. The timing of this vote in the fifty-fifty Senate comes just three months ahead of high stakes midterm election. The White House says it should be a signal to Americans to make their voices heard. Believing abortion will be a driving issue for voters this fall. The President has also called on Congress to codify Roe, which has stalled in the Senate.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 08.05.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.05.22/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Aug 2022 21:19:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.05.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, America’s economy has recovered from the pandemic. The labor market has regained the tens of millions of jobs lost when Covid first hit US shores. A stunningly strong jobs report shows a hiring surge in July. Employers added five hundred and twenty thousand jobs last month, the biggest game since February. The unemployment rate down to three and half percent after the lowest rate after fifty years. The gain were across many sectors including leisure and hospitality businesses and professional services, government and construction. But there are still flashing warning signs ahead as inflation remains high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That 3.5% unemployment number come with a caveat because the overall labor pool is getting smaller. Sixty-three thousand people left workforce last month alone. And while low unemployment is usually a good thing, the recovery remains uneven. A summer surprise, the labor market bouncing back taking two and half years undo what Covid did in a matter of weeks. The stunning July job numbers mean the economy has now recouped all twenty-two million jobs loss early in the pandemic. But the news is not all good. Small businesses like Ford’s Fish Shack and Loudon County, Virginia still cannot find enough workers. Even after raising wages, owner T is down at least twenty percent of his workforce. And his cost has jumped by a third. Customers are also cutting back. Wages grew by over five percent last month well behind the rate of inflation, meaning many workers are making more but living less. The food &lt;strong&gt;pantry&lt;/strong&gt; at St. Thomas Church in Richmond is seeing triple the number of families in need. What the employment numbers won’t do is slowing down inflation and that may prompt the Federal Reserve to pursue another substantial rate hike as soon as next month.&lt;/p&gt;

Today, a Russian judge give he a nine-year sentence after finding her guilty of drug possession and smuggling. The two-time Olympic gold medalist, pleaded with the Russian judge not to quote “end her life”, and apologized saying she never intended to break any laws or hurt anyone. The US consider G as another American prisoner wrongfully detained by Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The White House was &lt;strong&gt;unequivocal&lt;/strong&gt; today, B.G should never had to stand trial let alone be sentenced to nearly a decade behind bars. But there is also hope tonight that the Russians may finally negotiate in earnest prisoner exchange. Now the sentencing phase is over. From a cage in the courtroom, WNBA star B.G expressed remorse, but that did not stop her Russian judge from sentencing her to nine years in a penal colony. President B called it unacceptable. The six-foot center was on the way to play in Russia when she was arrested in February. Russian authority accused her of drug smuggling. After finding less than a gram of cannabis oil in her luggage. In a bid to bring B.G and another American P.W home, US officials have proposed a prisoner swap, possibly involving Russian drug dealer, V.B. But the Russian said they wouldn’t negotiate until G is sentenced. It’s very unusual for US officials to even discuss for proposed prisoner swaps in public. But this time, they say they feel like no choice because they made an offer to the Russians and waited weeks without getting a serious response.&lt;/p&gt;

Voters turned out in droves with numbers on par with a general election. At the White House, the President said Republicans quote “don’t’ have a clue about the power of American women, last night in Kansas, they found out”. The President also signed an executive order aimed at making it easier for women seeking abortion to travel between states to obtain care. Election results from five states show former President T remain highly influential in Republican party, with several 2020 election deniers winning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, those votes surprised many on the ground here in Kansas because it’s a conservative state. D.T won here by nearly fifteen points in 2020. And Republicans controlled the state legislature with a super majority. But voter turnout broke records and sent a message heard around the country. In conservative Kansas, an unlikely victory for abortion rights. Voters rejected the measure that would have removed abortion protections from the state constitution which would have paved the way for Republican legislature to enact further restrictions. Anti-abortion rights groups say this is just a setback. The results were decisive with fifty-nine percent voting to keep the current abortion rights in place, reflective of the national mood. The CBS battleground tracker shows fifty-six of voters disapprove of the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe V Wade. It’s the dynamic activists are hoping translates to other states. In November, Kentucky will have a similar ballot question. On Montana will have a “Born alive” measure. California and Vermont will ask voters if they want to codify abortion rights into state’s constitution. Democrats hope the issue will galvanize their voters in the midterms. President B ordered an executive order today that would expand access to reproductive healthcare including helping women travel out of state to receive abortions. But without federal protections, abortion access remains a &lt;strong&gt;patchwork&lt;/strong&gt;. And Kansas actually become destination for patients seeking care from states where procedure is banned. And clinics like the one behind me are already seeing a rush of patients.&lt;/p&gt;

The highest ranking American official in twenty-five years to visit the self-ruled island that Beijing claims as its own. P was greeted on the tarmac at Taipei’s International Airport by Taiwan foreign minister and other Taiwanese and American government officials. In a statement upon arriving, P said the visit honors America’s unwavering commitment to supporting Taiwan’s vibrant democracy. China responded to the visit by putting its military on high alert and announcing a series of military demonstrations in the waters of Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guessing about P’s plan ended with this late night touched down in Taipei. The House Speaker was greeted by local officials, even hailed with a welcome message on Taiwan’s tallest skyscraper. But across the narrow Taiwan Strait, China responded, announcing new live fire military drills encircling Taiwan. And warning that the US would pay the price for undermining China’s interest. Here in Washington, the administration offers cautious backing for the trip, but they weren’t always so supportive. To reduce tensions, Speaker P’s flight path from Malaysia took her away from the Chinese mainland and the China’s south sea. The journey was tracked by nearly three million people online and earned her rara praise from Republicans back home. P isn’t the first lawmaker to visit Taiwan this year. But she is the first House Speaker to do so in twenty-five years. And she has been a thorn in China’s eyes since 1991 when she unfurled a prodemocracy banner in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square. In an op-ed today, P said she made the trip because she quote “We cannot stand by as China proceeds to threaten Taiwan”. One of things the White House will be watching for is whether China tries to retaliate against the US or Taiwan economically. In fact, just today, China suddenly banned shipments from one hundred Taiwanese food exports.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 08.01.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.01.22/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Aug 2022 19:54:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-08.01.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;President B just announced the successful counter terrorism strike that killed top Al Qaeda leader A. over the weekend.

A. took over as the leader of Al Qaeda following the 2011 raid that killed B.L. The former senior military official describes the decade-long hunt for O.L’s successor as unfinished business, adding that the leader quote “haunted the US for as long as he remain alive”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President B said the drone strike that took out A. was the result of months of surveillance and planning. A. has been the leader of Al Qaeda for more than a decade ever since O.L killed by US Seal in Pakistan in 2011. But even before he took over, A. helped to plan 911 attack and other terror attacks on Americans. He was seventy-one years old, a doctor who was born into a prominent family. It was his family’s decision to relocate to a housing that tipped off US officials who monitored the home for months before strike. The operation comes after nearly one year after the US’s last forces and diplomats left Afghanistan, bring out faster than intended after the government and military fell to the advancing Taliban. The Taliban not happy about this operation. A senior military official says it was two held-fire missiles from unmanned drone that took out A as he stood on a balcony of the home in Kabul, a deliberate choice that was made they say in order to preserve the structural integrity of building and spare the lives of the civilians inside.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 07.31.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.31.22/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Aug 2022 19:15:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.31.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, tens of millions of Americans are dealing with extreme weather.

While California tonight, battles the state’s biggest fire so fire this year. The inferno seen here from space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a similar scene from the pacific to the plains, wildfires burning out of control. The McKinney fire near the California-Oregon border is forcing more than two thousand people to leave their homes. It’s fueled by triple digit temperatures, erratic winds and thunderstorms with dry lightning. The fast-moving fire, which started Friday, is torching through more than fifty-one thousand acres and prompted the rescue of sixty hikers. It’s one of the nation’s fifty-four large fires burning in thirty states destroying more than 1.5 million acres. In Montana, it’s the Alamo fire north of Missoula. It’s exploding in size to more than eleven thousand acres. And in Idaho, this pyrocumulous cloud formed over the Moose fire which is charring more than sixty seven square miles. And a series of lightning strikes maybe to blame for a fire scorching farmland in western Nebraska. It’s forcing the evacuation of homes and livestock. Now, there are seven active fires burning here in the state of California. And with the heat wave in parts of the west and very little rain in the plains, the fear is these fires will just keep sparking and burning.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening 07.29.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-07.29.22/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Jul 2022 16:55:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-07.29.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, the death toll in Kentucky continues to rise following what the governor called the worst flooding disaster he has ever seen. At least sixteen people are dead including six children and sadly, those numbers are expected to climb. Floodwaters have wiped out entire communities in some of the poorest places in the country. Search-and-rescue teams backed by the National Guards are going door to door, frantically looking for the missing. President B has issued a major disaster declaration, freeing up the federal money for the recovery effort. It is the latest in a string of catastrophic natural disasters this summer. Floods, extreme drought, and wildfires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entire town have been flooded, roads destroyed, and major infrastructure, power, water, and cell phone service wiped out. Crews have already rescued nearly three hundred people and many more are unaccounted for. This afternoon, governor A.B toured the region by helicopter and later warned the death toll will go up. Floodwaters triggered by torrential rains surge through the small town of Hindman, &lt;strong&gt;inundating&lt;/strong&gt; elementary school and leaving it under a thick crust of mud. Classes were to begin in less than two weeks, but not anymore. Kentucky is just one of several states left reeling from severe flooding. Monsoonal rains washed through parts of Nevada, soaking unlucky gamblers on the Las Vegas strip. Scientists say climate change amplifies these storms and damage they leave behind. In Kentucky, the recovery will be slow. Both search and rescue teams continue to work here east Kentucky as more rain falls. It is going to be a daunting task. Some of the water is not expected to recede until Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;

A phenomenon that happens in some cases after people take Paxlovid. That’s the antiviral therapy from Pfizer taken as the pill. In a video released today, the President says he is feeling fine. But again, he is isolating at the White House and canceled his weekend travel plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the President’s doctor, he tested positive this morning on an antigen test and he did tweet a video. Now the President’s doctor says it’s the rebound case as you mentioned. It’ rare but known issue after taken that antiviral Paxlovid which the President took for several days following his initial diagnosis on July.21st. He then had four negative tests in a row even celebrating a rose garden speech before testing positive again today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now to flood-ravaged Kentucky, the death toll rose again today. At least twenty-five people have been killed. And rain is again forecast for this weekend, as rescue crews struggle to get to the hardest hit areas swamped by what’s described as the worst flooding to hit region in decades.
Kentucky is racing to recover as receding floodwaters revealed a scope of devastation in the state’s hard-struck Appalachian region. Entire communities were wiped out in the catastrophe.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 07.28.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.28.22/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Jul 2022 18:55:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.28.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, for the second time this week, catastrophic flooding has forced Americans to flee their homes in the middle of the night, this time in Eastern Kentucky. Six to ten inches of rains cause widespread flash flooding across Appalachia, washing out roads and bridges and pushing homes off their foundations. At least eight people are dead but Kentucky’s governor warns the death toll will likely rise to double digits these coming days. The governor also said that hundreds of properties could be destroyed in one of the worst, most devastating flooding events in state history. Well tonight, a state of emergency is in effect and the National Guard has been activated. The Kentucky Red Cross is on the ground in ninety counties affected by the floodings and more rain is on the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this morning about thirty residents were rescued from their homes and they are telling us this is the worst flooding here in forty-five years. The North Fork Kentucky River in Whitesburg reached nearly eleven feet above flood stage today. As much as six inches of rain fall in less than three hours, triggering fast rising flood waters in the Eastern parts of Kentucky. When the sun came up, Buckhorn Elementary in hard-hit Perry County was completely under water. A state of emergency remains in effect. Roads in many areas are impassable. First responders were forced to brave swift moving waters to rescue people from their homes. The same weather system caused deadly flooding in St. Louis earlier this week. And tonight, with more rain in the forecast, residents are bracing for more devastation. Forty-one thousand customers in Kentucky are without power. Cell service is spotty, residents can’t get back in here until the water recedes. And then the remediation process gets underway.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 07.27.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.27.22/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Jul 2022 19:47:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.27.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, we begin with the state of the American economy and the battle against inflation. The Federal Reserve today making a move to try and tamp down rising prices by raising interests rates by seventy-five base points. That means the central bank back-to-back rate hike of a combined one point five percentage points since June is the most since 1980s. Wall Street anticipated the move and stocks rallied in afternoon trading. All three major indexes scored triple digits gain with the tech-heavy NASDAQ jumping more than four percent, the most in more than two years. As the price people pay for consumer goods climbed to a forty-one year high in June, today’s move is designed to slow the economy without causing recession. And it comes as mortgage rates have soared doubling since the beginning of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight, Fed Chair J.P says the US is not in a recession yet, but the path to avoid one is getting narrower. In fact, he did not rule out another significant rate hike in September. What this move today means, it is likely going to cost more to borrow money in mortgage, car loan or even debt in your credit card. It was another aggressive move for the central bank pushing its benchmark rate to the highest in four years. The Federal Reserve’s move follows consumer prices shooting up more than nine percent in June compared to last year. Tomorrow Wall Street is going to be watching another key economic indicator, GDP. It is expected to show two consecutive quarters of negative growth, traditionally, historically. That is the sign that a recession is looming.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 07.26.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.26.22/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Jul 2022 19:06:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.26.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We want to begin with what’s being described as a catastrophic extreme weather on the Midwest. The record rainfall caused deadly flash flooding in the St. Louis area. At least one person was killed. Fire and emergency crews rescued more than one hundred people from homes and vehicles. More than a foot of rain in some areas have surpassed multiple one hundred-year-old records. All four major interstates leaving the downtown area were closed as water swamped the roadways. And there is more rain ahead and forecasters are concerned that parts of the Ohio river valley could see more than half of foot rain at the end of the week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here in St. Peters just northwest of St. Louis it’s been so soaked with more than a foot of rainfall. A lot of which fell before sunrise, leaving many residents here forced to flee these flooding waters in darkness risks of getting trapped. St. Louis wake up under water. By 7A.M, eight inches of rain had fallen, shutting down four major highways near the city. Roads were overwhelmed. Cars drowned in the water were left abandoned, with homes and businesses not spared from the historic flash flooding. First responders across the area ferried more than a hundred residents from their drenched homes and trapped vehicles. While others waded through waist-deep waters. At least one person was found dead in a submerged vehicle. The flooding prompted rescues in multiple animal shelters. But it was too late for ten poppies that drowned. As the rain moved on, many took refuge in shelters while they figure out their next steps. Officials said late this afternoon, the threat is not over, four more inches of rain could fall which could lead to more flooding and damage the homes.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 07.25.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.25.22/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Jul 2022 18:38:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.25.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, record high temperatures across the country are fueling wildfires in fifteen states, the largest, in Northern California. Smoke now visible from the international space station. The oak fire exploded over the weekend as it burned out of control through a bone-dry forest. Firefighters have battled the flames for four straight days. The fire has burned nearly seventeen thousand acres and its ten percent contained. Thousands of homes and businesses in a mountain community near Yosemite National Park remained under evacuation orders. Smoke has spread hundreds of miles away reaching Lake Tahoe, parts of Nevada, and the San Francisco Bay area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Progress here on the frontline is measured by minute. And this evening, this fire continues to explode as it rips through dry vegetation. It’s also incredibly unpredictable even for firefighters. More than twenty-five hundred firefighters are now on the line, working around the clock in intense heat and on steep terrain to put down so called Oak fire from both the ground and air. The vegetation is bone-dry. It doesn’t take much to turn it into fire like this. There has been a stroke of some luck. The wind has remained calm. It only takes a gust though to turn fire like this into a wall of flames. The fire has already incinerated more than sixteen thousand acres, destroyed seven structures, including homes. But that number is expected to rise. More than six thousand people are under evacuation orders. Years of drought across the western US and high temperatures over recent days had fueled flames reaching fifteen feet into the sky. And while wind conditions remain favorable there is the threat of gust picking up tonight as well as dry lightning, which could ignite this tinderbox.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 07.24.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.24.22/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Jul 2022 20:09:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.24.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with nearly eighty million of you dealing with sweltering temperatures and extreme weather conditions today. Thermometers reach triple digits across the Northeast and Washington DC, New York City and Philadelphia. The heat has blamed for at least two deaths. Newark, New Jersey hit one hundred degrees today, the fifth day in a row and the longest streak ever reported for that city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These extreme hot temperatures are not just uncomfortable they are deadly. The National Weather Service says in the last thirty years, more people have died from heat than any other weather-related cause. Week after week, extreme temperatures are taking a toll across the country. Heat exposure is to blame for at least one death in New York City. But despite brutal temps, racers competed in a shortened triathlon today. Parts of the Northeast, battle near triple digits this weekend. Washington DC, heat indexes are approaching one hundred ten in some urban areas. It’s so hot that the Amtrak fears the blazing temps could expand train tracks. The rail line is warning commuters to expect delays between Philadelphia and New York. If it feels like extreme weather is getting worse every year, that’s because it is. Now some experts warned because the oceans are also getting warmer there is more water operation in the air which makes the air feels a lot sticker and those heat indexes are a lot higher.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 07.23.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.23.22/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Jul 2022 18:39:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.23.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;In the nation’s capital, people are trying get whatever relief they could, as temperatures reached ninety-seven degrees today, the hottest weekend so far this year. And the heat wave there continues through Monday. In Florida, police investigating a baby’s death after he was left in a hot car. This marks eleven hot car fatalities in the US this year. And today, Amtrak is warning of more heat related delays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC warns more than six hundred people in the US died every year from extreme heat. And doctors advise that deaths are preventable. They say make sure wear lightweight clothing and drink plenty of water. From Massachusetts to Arizona, millions of Americans are battling intense heat this week, with many excessive heat warnings and advisories. A Pennsylvania pool is running on shorter hours this weekend in part to protect the staff. In Boston, the dangerous forecast contributed to postponing Sunday’s triathlon. Nationwide, designated cooling centers are available for folks trying to get a break. But in 2021 study published in the international journal of environmental research and public health looked at twenty-five cities with these centers and found that about eighty-nine percent of people over sixty-five did not have walkable access. Researchers fear the number of adults at risk could be higher since so many are not mobile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The heat wave has also prompted severe thunder storm warnings here in Midwest and in the Northeast.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 07.22.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.22.22/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Jul 2022 21:37:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.22.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, the President is in Covid isolation in the White House residence, but keeping up with brisk work pace that according to his spokesperson. Mr. B, seventy-nine held a virtual meeting with his advisors to survey turbulent economic trends still above-average gas prices. He appeared in good spirits but his voice sounded a bit &lt;strong&gt;hoarse&lt;/strong&gt;. He gave reporters a thumbs up when they asked how he was feeling. President’s doctors say his symptoms have improved; he is responding well to antiviral medications. The White House continues to stress the President is well positioned and recover quickly because he has been double vaccinated and twice boosted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The White House is working very hard to convey that it is business as usual around here even with the Commander in Chief now in isolation. Today, they made sure that the public had plenty of opportunities to see that he is still on the job despite the diagnoses. Confined to the White House residence, President B conducted business by Zoom today. A couple coughs and a fog in his throat were the only outward signs of infection, as he discussed gas prices with his top aides. In a new letter, White House Doctor K.O said the President’s mild symptoms have improved. A 99.4F temperature last night, came down with Tylenol and has remained normal since then. The Doctor also recommended initiating low-aspirin as a temporary alternative to the President’s normal blood thinner which has had to be halted during the five-day course of the Covid antiviral drug, Paxlovid. The President interacted with dozens of people in the two days before he tested positive. Today, White House released the result of contact tracing.&lt;/p&gt;

Of course, that home is the White House and it is equipped by a full medical staff and team. The President tweeted out a photo and video since diagnosed. He just returned from the Middle East and Massachusetts on Wednesday where he came in contact with several members of Congress. The First Lady and Vice President K.H are also considered close contacts. As of now, neither of them has tested positive. More than two years into the pandemic, cases are once again on the rise. Health officials are blaming the BA-5 Omicron subvariant. New cases are up more than twenty-seven percent in the last month alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;White House protocols helped to protect the President from contracting Covid for more than two years. But now he has joined the estimated two hundred million Americans who have been infected with this virus. Speaking from a White House balcony, a slightly congested President B said he is feeling well enough to keep working in isolation. In a letter, Dr. M said Mr. B tested positive for Covid during a routine screening this morning and has developed mild symptoms including a running nose, fatigue and occasional dry cough. The President was promptly prescribed a five-day course of Paxlovid, an antiviral drug that dramatically reduces the risk of severe Covid. Visiting school in Detroit, the First Lady immediately slipped on mask. Contact tracing has begun. The President spent time yesterday with three Senators and the governor of Rhode Island. On Tuesday, he welcomed Ukraine’s First Lady to the White House. Test will confirm whether the seventy-nine-old President was infected by the highly contagious BA-5 subvariant which is now responsible for nearly eighty percent of all US cases. The number of daily cases has nearly tripled in the past three months. And hospitalizations are up twenty percent just in the past two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 07.20.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.20.22/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Jul 2022 21:55:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.20.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, it’s another day of extreme heat across the country and Europe as triple digits temperatures are being felt around world. More than one third of the US are under excessive heat warnings and advisories as local health officials ask residents to check in on their neighbors, especially the elderly. The scorching heat combined with bone-dry conditions is also fueling wildfires with almost ninety fires burning in thirteen states. In Europe, nearly two thousand people have died because of the hot water. Firefighters in Greece struggled to contain new fires around the capital of Athens. And in London, fires are now under control following the busiest day for the city’s fire brigade since World War II.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It hit a hundred and nine today. It feels like one hundred and fourteen. And for many people here, it’s starting to feel like Groundhog Days as Dallas hasn’t seen high temperature dip below ninety-six since June 4th. There has been no measurable rain in forty-six days, and all of that is just fueling the fire danger. Firefighters continue to brave temperatures hovering around a hundred and ten battling eighteen active wildfires burning across Texas threatening twelve hundred homes. Drought conditions driven by weeks of triple digits heat are turning the Lone Star State into a tinderbox. It’s so hot, Texas trains are slowing down. The Dallas DART system capping speed at thirty miles an hour. All city libraries are now acting as cooling centers. Now the weather pattern slow roasting Midwest is moving east. A power outage in Medford, Massachusetts cut off a sea to thousands. Nearby Boston is under heat emergency. In New York City, temperatures could reach up to a hundred. Over in Europe, the unprecedented heatwave is sparking fires across the continent. Heat blamed for more than nineteen hundred deaths. Outside Athens, police go door to door telling residents to run.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 07.19.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.19.22/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Jul 2022 22:19:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.19.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, the heat is on across much of the country as the scorching hot summer grips the nation. Brutal and dangerous temperatures are being felt from California to Massachusetts. More than one hundred and twenty million Americans are under excessive heat warnings or advisories with triple digits temperatures expected from the Great Plains to lower Mississippi valley. The National Weather Service says that more than sixty record highs will be set across twenty states by the end of the week. Europe’s record heat wave has resulted in Britain officially declaring a its highest recorded temperature while the London Fire Brigade declared a major incident after multiple fire broke out in and around London.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hit a hundred and ten here. Paramedics say that’s not only dangerous heat, that’s potentially deadly heat. Something that tragically played out in Tallahassee, Florida this afternoon. An eleven-month-old died after being left inside a hot car. And tonight, growing concerns over the toll of this unrelenting heat. A major power scare at Hoover Dam. As the mercury soared into triple digits, a transformer explosion sent smoke billowing. The dam supplies power to California, Nevada and Arizona. West Dallas, this intense heat fueled wildfire burned a number of homes as temperatures reached a hundred eleven. Currently eighty-five large fires are burning scorching more than three million acres in thirteen states. Twenty-four days in the triple digits is also taking a toll on Texas infrastructure. Drought conditions are causing the ground to shift, breaking waterlines. Of the nearly five hundred breaks in Fort Worth this year. Almost forty percent have come in the last month. The fragile Texas power grid is keeping pace with record demand as pleas for customers to conserve electricity continue. Meteorologists say the weather pattern is stuck driving warmer and drier condition north creating a drought which in turn prompts more hot temperatures resulting in parts of California, Arizona and the central plains stifling under a heat dome.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 07.18.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.18.22/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Jul 2022 19:39:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.18.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We want to begin tonight in Uvalde, Texas where the first comprehensive assessment of the law enforcement response to the massacre at Robb Elementary School that killed nineteen students and two teachers. The seventy-seven-page report details the seventy-seven minutes of what’s referred to as a &lt;strong&gt;lackadaisical&lt;/strong&gt; approach. And it places blame on the entirety of law enforcement who responded to the shooting. Nearly four hundred officers were on the scene. And for the first time, we’re getting disturbing body cam videos. According to the report, officers rushed to the school but inexplicably waited for more than an hour before confronting the gunman. The report also has alarming details about the shooter, saying he was a dropout who had developed a fascination with school shootings of which he made no secret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That report concluded that law enforcement prioritized their safety over the lives of innocent victims. And tonight, we’re hearing from the two agencies that had the largest number of officers and agents present. That’s Customs and Border Protection and the Texas Department of Public Safety both saying that they have launched internal investigations into the response. We also learned from family members that they were told by the investigators saying the shooter had attended the fourth grade in that very classroom and that he had been bullied in the fourth grade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, there seems to be no place in America that is safe from the scourge of gun violence that’s infected every aspect of our lives, and this weekend was no difference. In just two days, there were sixteen mass shootings across the country that killed at least fourteen people and injured fifty-six others, that includes a deadly shooting at a shopping mall in Greenwood, Indiana.&lt;/p&gt;

The extensive document chronicles a leadership failure across multiple agencies, poor decision making amid the chaos, and a history of ignoring early clues about the trouble gunman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We learned more about the gunman today, including that he had never fired a gun before, that he had suicidal ideation, that he glorified violence online and that he had sociopathic tendencies but nobody who came in contact with him ever alerted authorities about him. The investigation, conducted by a Texas House committee, highlights a series of systematic failures and egregious poor decision making by three hundred and seventy-six law enforcement in offices. The seventy-seven pages report in surveillance video was given to the victim’s families Sunday morning. The report blamed a lack of leadership that extended beyond local police, saying quote “hundreds of responders from numerous law enforcement agencies, many of whom were better trained and better equipped than the school district police quickly arrived on the scene”. A longer version of the surveillance video was leaked by local media last week, it shows the gunman entering Robb Elementary. And it is different than edited version parents got today. You can see him firing over a hundred rounds between the rooms he entered in two and half minutes. After a small group of local officers approached to the classrooms were shot at through the walls and retreated, dozens of officers then gathered in the hallway for more than an hour, pacing, asking for equipment and ultimately killed the gunman. During that time, today’s report states the void of leadership by chief A, who failed to take his role as incident commander and others who didn’t step up could have contributed to the loss of life. The report adds those officers quote “failed to prioritize saving the lives of innocent victims over their own safety”&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 07.16.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.16.22/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Jul 2022 21:03:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.16.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with the President historic and controversial visit to the Middle East, President B met twice with the man he called pariah on the campaign trail, Saudi crown prince M.S. The President assured he pressed the crown prince on human right abuses and the murder of US based Saudi journalist J.K. As you might remember, the US intelligence said K’s murder in Turkey was approved by M.S. But at this summit, Mr. B primary message was one of partnership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, President B now is on his way back home after four days in Middle East meeting design to do two things, reassured American leadership in this region, and warn Iran not to go nuclear. President B spent his final day in the Middle East once again in the presence of Saudi Arabia’s crown prince M.S. The scene came a day after two leaders greeted each other with the fist-bump. A viral moment quickly being around the world. The President was a big draw ??? the region crown prince including one on one time for Mr. B with the heads of each Iraq, Jordan and United Arab Emirates. Iran especially has been a big focus of the visit. Early Saturday, the White House warned it’s now backing V.P’s war in Ukraine by providing armed drones. It released a satellite image, reportedly shown armed drones in the airfield in northern Iran on June 8th with the US officials describe as a Russian delegation transport on scene. The B trip began with a new agreement between the US and Israel ??? partner to stop Iran’s nuclear ambitions. Even though Mr. B also wants to restart global negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program, something Israel strongly opposes. The President also announced new economic aid to the Palestinians even though he admitted Israel and Palestinian peace talks are a way off. And in Saudi he announced a series of regional, economic, technological and military agreements when squared off the crown prince over human rights.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 07.15.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.15.22/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Jul 2022 20:50:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.15.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, we want to begin in Saudi Arabia where President B is on day three of his four-day trip to the Middle East. It’s his first trip as the President to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to meet the King and the country’s de facto leader, crown prince M.S. Today, Mr. B said he told M.S to this face that he believes the young leader is to blame for the killing of Washington Post contributor, J.K. The President defended his visit to Saudi Arabia despite its poor human rights record, saying the country is vital to the security in the region. American officials also announced a number of agreements with Saudi Arabia on topics like energy, security, building 5G networks, opening Saudi airspace to Israeli flights, and extending a &lt;strong&gt;truce&lt;/strong&gt; in Yemen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight’s meeting capped months of careful negotiation between the White House and the Kingdom over how and with whom exactly the president would spend his time here. On the agenda, Middle East peace, military cooperation, high gas prices and the murder of a prominent critic of the Saudi royal family. With the bump of two fists, President B today gave media savvy Saudi Crown Prince, M.S the viral moment he’s been seeking. The President was reluctant to meet with M.S as he’s known, having denounced him publicly after US intelligence confirmed the Saudi leader ordered the murder of one of his critics, Washington Post columnist, J.K. Mr. B said he raised the killing at the start of his meeting with M.S with a fist bump and continued other top US officials.&lt;/p&gt;

Tonight, we have new reporting on which witness the former President allegedly tried to call, raising questions about witness tampering. And just as the investigation is zeroing on D.T himself, he is trying to distract by letting it be known that he&amp;rsquo;s made a decision about whether or not he’ll run for the White House again in 2024. And there is this bombshell we are just learning about. Members of the secret service erased messages from Jan.5th and Jan.6th that’s according to the Department of Homeland Security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the committee sets its sights on the next phase of investigation, what it calls dereliction of duty by former President T, they’re accusing T of interfering with the investigation. Even as T talks about big announcement on his own. With revelations from the Jan.6th committee frustrating D.T, the former President is accused of tampering with a potential witness. CBSN has confirmed that individual who was sharing information with the committee was a White House employee. The individual didn’t take the call and was concerned, given he or she didn’t routinely communicate with Mr. T. The committee says the call came soon after the blockbuster hearing featuring former T White House aide C.H in which H testified T wanted to join the mob at the Capitol Jan.6th. The individual T called was potentially prepared to cooperate parts of H’s testimony. It’s the latest in a series of accusations of possible witness tampering. The committee says it’s still interested in hearing from former T White House advisor S.B. In a newly released audio from just before election day in 2020, B is heard predicting T would claim victory no matter what.&lt;/p&gt;

The consumer price index jumped 9.1% compared to one year ago, as the cost of pretty everything is going up. Every American is feeling the pinch in their wallet as the average household spent almost $500 last month to buy the same goods and services as they did in 2021. Increase was largely driven by gas and energy prices, which soared last month, along with a spike in rents not seen since the mid-80s. Stocks closed a bit lower on the news, and all this is leading to fears for the economy with Bank of America today forecasting a mild recession starting in the second half of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This report shows prices for everyday life going up more than even economists expected. And with wages falling behind, many Americans feel they’re running out of options. Inflation is still running hot this summer. Today’s consumer price index report shows American paid more last month for just about every necessity, with inflation surging to a forty-one-year high. Gas prices led the way, up nearly sixty percent from the same time last year. That pulled energy prices more than forty percent. Food prices continue to be sky-high, with meals at home costing family’s twelve percent more than last year. Another driver, rents, saw their highest one-month jump in nearly forty years. Today, President B said in statement that June’s inflation numbers were unacceptably high and were out of date, given the recent drop in gas prices. The average cost of a gallon of gasoline peaked at about $5 last month. This week, it’s nearly forty cents lower. With today’s higher than anticipating numbers, the Federal Reserve is expected to continue its assault on inflation. We could see another ¾ point increase later this month. But that comes with risks. Now there could be some relief on the way, since mid-June, gas prices have steadily been going down each day. An industry analyst GasBuddy predicts, it could fall below $4 per gallon a month from now.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 07.12.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.12.22/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Jul 2022 20:49:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.12.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin with breaking news. Tonight, we’re getting an excruciating look inside Robb Elementary School, where nineteen children and two teachers were gunned down during the last days of school. The Austin American-Statesman Newspaper published parts of the security video, removing the sounds of kids screaming. But what’s easy to hear, is the noise from the hundreds of rounds fired by the shooter. In the difficult-to-watch surveillance video, we see the gunman entered the school at 11:30 AM local time. And then police officer from multiple agencies waiting to confront and stop the gunman in a classroom nearby. It wasn’t until 12:50 PM, an hour and seventeen minutes later, when police finally confronted the man who carried out the massacre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first time, you’re seeing the horrifying moments the gunman entered Robb Elementary in Uvalde. The gunman walking down an empty hallway stopping to fire into classrooms. A student spots the shooter as he rounds the corner and runs away. Three minutes later, the first police enter the building. They’re shot at by the gunman, and they runaway. The video released by Austin American-Statesman then jumps to nineteen minutes later. Now, there’s even larger and more heavily armed police present. But still, no entry to the classrooms where the gunman fired more than one hundred rounds, killing nineteen children and two teachers. It is difficult to watch. For long periods of time, officers stand in the hallway. One officer walking over to a wall-mounted hand sanitizer in the midst of carnage. At seventy-seven minutes into the edited video, the breach is made into the classroom, and a barrage of gunfire can be heard. The release has been part of a fight between numerous government officials and agencies, including the Uvalde district attorney who opposed it. Those calling for its release, including victims’ families hoped it would help explain the delayed response and why officers put their own safety ahead of those children. But tonight, it has only raised more questions. That video was supposed to be shown to the families and the communities first on Sunday. That was the plan by the Texas legislative committee investigating. Tonight, the head of Texas Department of Public Safety says he is deeply disturbed that they did not get to see it first.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 07.11.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.11.22/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Jul 2022 19:54:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.11.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, in California a fast-growing wildfire in Yosemite National Park is threatening the park’s famous giant sequoias. Some of the largest and oldest trees in the world. These national treasures have survived everything for thousands of years, and they’re now in jeopardy because of climate change. Hundreds of firefighters are battling the fires under brutal conditions, with heavy terrain, blistering temperatures and low humidity. The Washburn fire, which grew more than five-fold over the weekend, is now more than twenty-three hundred acres and it’s twenty five percent contained. Firefighters have set up special containment lines around the sequoias and even set up a sprinkler system to help protect some of the most famous trees in the planet. In nearby Utah, record heat and high winds are fueling two massive wildfires that have burned a total of more than eighteen square miles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Park Rangers tell me they’re hopeful they can save these sequoias but in the past few minutes, we have watched this fire explode around these trees, setting a dark plume of toxic smoke up into the sky. Tonight, the world’s largest trees are under threat. At Yosemite National Park, firefighters are enduring scorching heat as out of control wildfires continue to rage, and as they race to save a treasure. Five hundreds of Yosemite giant sequoias are threatened by this fire. These are trees that in some cases, have survived all times of weather for thousands of years. At least one, the Grizzly Giant is nearly three thousand years old. The battle plan now to protect these ancient trees, fight fire with a new source of water. We scaled a two-hundred-foot sequoia with researchers in 2019. At the time, they believed the iconic trees were protected from wildfires thanks to their two-foot-thick bark. That’s no longer the case, California’s drought, worsen by climate change, has already taken a terrible toll on the sequoias, ten of thousands have been killed. In the past six years, eighty five percent of the giant sequoias habitat in the Sierra Nevada have been hit by wildfire, compared to just twenty five percent the previous century. A more immediate concern are flames so intense, that the fire is creating its own weather. Updrafts are sending debris into the sky. One air tanker reported a near miss. Tonight, the worst of the fire is burning away from the sequoias, but in a remote area that is hard to reach. Fire crews hope setting back burns like this will stop this blaze from growing.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 07.10.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.10.22/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Jul 2022 17:17:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.10.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with new developments from that Jan.6th committee investigating the Capitol attack in what many have called an attack on American democracy. So far, the committee has held six hearings. In this week, we could see the final two. The back-to-back hearings will focus on white nationalism and what former President D.T was doing when the Capitol was under sieged. Today, we’re learning new information following Friday’s close door testimony of former White House counsel P.C. In that eight-hour interviews, committee members say C. revealed new information and backed up what they have heard from other witnesses. And both of those things are going to play central roles in the final two schedules committee hearings later this week. In a statement today, the Jan.6th committee said former White House legal advisor P.C’s interview provided key points regarding D.T’s misconduct, including demonstrating the former President’s supreme dereliction of duty. Today, in Delaware, a bike riding President B interacted with reporters who asked about abortion. The President was also asked if he’s considering using his power to declare public health emergency to protect abortion rights. In an op ed for the Washington Post, the President said he knows a lot of people are against him going Saudi Arabia. But in order to counter Russia and compete with China, the US needs strategic allies like Saudi. He said human rights are and will always be a part of discussion.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 07.09.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.09.22/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Jul 2022 19:50:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.09.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with more than fifty million Americans on alert for dangerous heat this weekend. Triple digits temperature being felt across at least fifteen states. The Southern plains are sizzling. Today, records were set in ten cities. In California, flames are threating world’s largest trees in Yosemite National Park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple States are under red flag warning, that is the highest level of wildfires. It’s all due to a combination of high, blistering heat of low humidity and strong winds. Hundreds of firefighters are battling the Washburn fire from the air and the ground. The flames, still out of control in a southern corner of Yosemite National Park have forced evacuations that are threatening about five hundred giant sequoias. Heavy smoke blankets Yosemite. This timeline video shows just how quickly the wildfire exploded to more than seven hundred acres since it started in Thursday. In Utah, record breaking heat and high winds are fueling two massive wildfires. Authorities ordered evacuations of homes and campgrounds after the Dry Creek and Halfway Hill fires scorched more than eight thousand acres. At Glacier National Park in Montana, the problem is snow, too much of them. Tourists can’t drive the iconic “Going to the sun” road as crews are still working to clear it out. It’s now &lt;strong&gt;slated&lt;/strong&gt; to open next week. Also, welcoming the heat is Yellow Stone National Park, where the roads are finally dried up and reopened, after last month’s floods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are new demonstrations today over the divide over abortion rights, as it &lt;strong&gt;roils&lt;/strong&gt; the nation.&lt;/p&gt;

Flags were ordered to half-staff here in the United States to honor the country’s longest serving prime minister. A. met with four of the last US President including J.B when he was Vice President. Graphic video of the attack shows the final moments of A.’s life as he was gunned down while delivering a campaign speech. Now, what makes this shooting so stunning, Japan has some of the strictest gun control laws in the world. The suspect was quickly apprehended. Police say he used a homemade gun. They &lt;strong&gt;confiscated&lt;/strong&gt; similar weapons along with his personal computer when they raided his apartment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;S.A was truly a giant of Japan’s political landscape for more than fifty years. And his death is a national trauma. S.A was giving a political speech to a small crowd when a shot rang out behind him, then another. And he fell to the ground. His security tackled the gunman immediately, but it was too late. The former prime minister lay in the road with fatal wounds to his neck and chest. Shield by a blue tarp, he was medevacked to a local hospital where doctors tried to &lt;strong&gt;resuscitate&lt;/strong&gt; him with blood transfusions but in vain. The suspected gunman is forty-one-year-old T.A, ex-military man, whose weapon appeared to be made with pipes and duct tape. Police searching his home found even more homemade guns along with explosives. This is a huge shock in Japan where strict gun control laws mean shooting deaths are extremely rare. There was just one last year compared to more than forty-five thousand in the United States. All day world leaders paid their respects. President B signed a condolence the Japanese embassy in Washington, he said A.’s death had left him stunned and outraged. S.A was Japan’s longest serving prime minister, a right-wing nationalist and Hawk. He was a fierce supporter of Japan’s military and his country’s role as America’s trade and defense partner in the face of China’s rising threat. Japan’s gun laws contain really &lt;strong&gt;stringent&lt;/strong&gt; conditions, not only on mental health checks but also on the sale of ammunition. But it looks as if the suspect did an end run on both of those by making his gun at home.&lt;/p&gt;

But he is not leaving right away. The embattled leader says he’ll stay on until the successor chosen in early September. J’s nearly three years in office have been plagued by controversy, including his handling of coronavirus and his hosting of alcohol through government parties during the pandemic. The White House is closely watching who takes over and where that person stands on issues regarding the European Union and other policies that directly impact the US government. There are also indications that the UK’s support for Ukraine will not change. The Prime Minister called President Z today to reassure the leader that his country will continue to send military aid and support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was an extraordinary here at Downing Street. A day of political upheaval and drama played out on the most powerful street in the country. A prime minister who fought his entire career to be here, now forced out of the office, humiliated by his own party. In defeat yet defiant, B.J stepped up and stepped down. Sunk by one scandal too many after it emerged that J knew about the sexual misconduct history of an employee he promoted, and apparently lied about it. That triggered this week’s avalanche. It may not be the end quite yet, but it’s close. The charismatic friend of people who parlayed his promise to exit the European Union to a landslide conservative victory. A lead squandered by a series of scandals, accusations of lying and political &lt;strong&gt;blunders&lt;/strong&gt;. Today’s speech didn’t offer any apologies, no &lt;strong&gt;contrition&lt;/strong&gt;. A resignation speech that somehow avoided the word resignation. Instead, a list of the PM’s greatest hits. The Prime Minister said today he will stay until his successor is chosen. That could be in the fall. But many of his party want the Prime Minister to leave number ten immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

And we’re now learning R.C drove to Madison, Wisconsin, where contemplated another attack. CBSN obtained this picture, one of the weapons allegedly found in the car the suspect was driving. And there are new details about how police were able to &lt;strong&gt;apprehend&lt;/strong&gt; alleged gunman is being held right now without bond. The state’s attorney says he’ll likely face dozens of other charges. A seventh victim today was identified, the sixty-nine-year-old who attended the parade with his family. Those killed range in age from thirty-five to eighty-eight years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re learning a lot more about the investigation and manhunt. There were really two big breaks in this case. One, came from a good Samaritan who spotted the suspect’s car and not only called police but then followed that vehicle until officers were on scene. The twenty-one-year-old suspected in Highland Park 4th of July parade shooting, showed no emotion during his virtual court appearance. Investigators say R.C fired eighty-three rounds stopping to reload his rifle similar to this one seen here twice. Police say the suspect dropped the gun on the scene as he escaped disguised in women’s clothing. During the frantic eight-hour manhunt, police now say C stopped to see an &lt;strong&gt;acquaintance&lt;/strong&gt; and drove two and a half hours to Madison, Wisconsin. In the car with him, this gun approximately sixty rounds of ammunition. When he spotted another parade, he allegedly considered another shooting. Police say the suspect confessed for the shooting that killed seven and wounded thirty-eight others. But despite two encounters with police in 2019 involving threats of violence to himself or family members and a series of troubling social media posts, his parent’s attorney says they saw no warning signs. Prosecutors say they expect to add dozens of more charges basically one criminal charge for every round fired. But we should also know the suspect passed four separate background checks in the process of buying his five firearms legally.&lt;/p&gt;

And we have a breaking news. Authorities just announced seven counts of first-degree murder against twenty-one-year-old suspected of shooting dozens at a 4th of July parade in this suburb of Chicago. Tonight, we’re learning the names of six of the victims that were killed. And just today, a seventh died from their wounds. The oldest, 88. The two youngest victims, parents of a young boy. They were together at the parade. And that child is parentless. The investigation is just getting started but we’re learning new details tonight, including the suspect previous counter with police. And the gun violence isn’t unique to Highland Park. In the thirty hours since the shooting here, there have been an additional six mass shootings across America. From Oakland, California to Queens, New York. Police are telling us the suspect actually legally owned five firearms some were found in his home, one was found in the vehicle that he was driving at the time he was arrested and while he is talking to police, there remain a lot of unanswered questions. Tonight, twenty-one-year-old R.C is facing seven counts of first degree murder. Police said he sprayed more than seventy rounds down upon hundreds of people watching Highland Park 4th of July parade. Seven were killed, thirty-eight were wounded including at least four children. This is the suspect after the shooting, wearing what it appears to be women’s clothing as a disguise make his getaway. While the suspect’s motive remains a mystery, police are investigating his disturbing online history. The suspect left the gun behind, that allow the ATF and others to do a rapid gun trace to help identify where the gun came from. At the same time, the FBI and other investigators were piecing together a video timeline. That gave them an idea of who they were looking for, the vehicle they were looking for. The suspect went to his mother’s house nearby and then drove to neighboring Wisconsin and back into Illinois when he was spotted by police, pulled over and eventually arrested.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 07.04.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.04.22/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Jul 2022 18:36:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.04.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, at least six people killed and dozens more wounded in the nation’s latest mass shooting. It targeted Independence Day parade in suburb, Chicago. And some breaking news. The manhunt for the person of interest, twenty-two-year-old R.C is over. Police say the gunman opened fire from a rooftop in July 4th crowd in downtown, Highland Park, Illinois. The city of about thirty thousand people is located roughly twenty-five miles north of Chicago. President said he and the First Lady are shocked by yet another senseless shooting in America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five people died here on the scene, another died in nearby hospital. And among the dozens of victims. People shot here at this 4th of July parade. The oldest victim, eighty-five years old. The youngest, just eight. A sudden burst of gun fire, ten minutes after the start of the 4th of July parade, sent parade participants and spectators running for their lives. Police said the gunman opened fire from a nearby rooftop. A scene of chaos with lawn chairs, bicycles and strollers left behind, scattered along the parade route as people scrambled for safety. This is the ninety-fifth and the deadliest shooting since nineteen children and two teachers were killed in Uvalde, Texas. Investigators found a high-powered rifle at the scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight, Akron, Ohio is under state-emergency in the wake of protest over the fatal police shooting of a black man.

&lt;p&gt;The eight officers are on paid leave after the attempted traffic stop and deadly pursuit. The police union says those officers are cooperating with the investigations. New released body camera video shows the moments leading up of the deadly shooting of J.W. Akron police say the twenty-five-year-old delivery driver sped off when they tried to pull him over for a traffic violation last week. During the chase, investigators claimed W fired from the window of his car, a claim his family disputes. Video shows W exiting the car on foot wearing a ski mask. Authorities say officers tried to use tasers to stop him, but opened fire when he turned around to face them. Investigators says W was hit dozens of times. W never fired a shot during the foot chase. But officers say they found a gun and a loaded magazine in his car. Hundreds of demonstrators have gathered in Akron this weekend to protest. W’s family and city leaders are urging protesters to remain peaceful. Once the state’s investigation is complete, the case will be handed over to the Ohio attorney general’s office for further review before presented to a grand jury for evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 07.02.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.02.22/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Jul 2022 18:19:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.02.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;If you’ve already arrived at your destination this holiday weekend. Consider yourself lucky. Traffic is backed up on the highways and in airports causing headaches and missed flights connections. Nearly two and a half million people went through TSA checkpoints Friday, the most since before the pandemic. Take a look at FlightAware’s so-called Misery Map. Thousands were greeted with the delays and cancellations. More than six hundred flights were canceled. And nearly thirty-nine hundred left late. That’s why millions opted to drive despite high gas prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summer storms and airline staffing shortages are partially to blame for long lines at airports, resulting in shorter vacations for thousands of Americans. Across the country, families are hoping to get a little freedom from their regular lives this Independent holiday weekend. Thousands of grounded fliers aren’t so lucky. The forty-two million Americans opting to hit the roads this holiday weekend aren’t dealing with the cancellations, but they are dealing with costly fill-ups. The national average for a gallon of regular hovered around $4.82 Saturday $1.7 more than it was just a year ago. For drivers and fliers who just want to relax at their final destinations, they say it’s worth it. Now while it’s quiet here in Newark, experts say give yourself plenty time both on highways and in the air. For airports, the advice is three hours ahead of your schedule flight time. The weather is making travel worse.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 07.01.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.01.22/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Jul 2022 18:45:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-07.01.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, the July 4th holiday weekend is off to a &lt;strong&gt;hectic&lt;/strong&gt; start, as the nation matches pre-pandemic travel numbers. Travel snags are causing major headaches nationwide. Airlines and passengers worry about potential horrors thanks to staff shortages and larger than expected crowds. Long lines and short tempers could ruin some Independent Day celebrations. Airlines are urging their customers to check their flight status before heading to the airports. So far today there have been more than five hundred cancellations and fifty-one hundred delays. Still, that’s kind of news because it’s fewer than we saw earlier this week. In Dallas, a Southwest Airline flight with a hundred and forty-one passengers on board with forced to abort because of a mechanic issue. Fortunately, nobody was hurt. Meanwhile, the roads and highways will be very busy. AAA tells us a record forty-two million Americans will drive to their holiday destinations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some Americans on their way right now to their hopefully enjoyable 4th of July destinations are getting there by car. And part of the reason is because where I’m standing has become almost a dreaded place. Tonight, airline delays and cancellations are adding up once again, which does not bode well for the weekend. The highways are humming, a record number of drivers are already enroute for the holiday, despite paying an average of $4.84 per gallon of the gas. Cars snaked around this Los Angeles gas station today, lured by a $50 gas giveaway as California’s new gas tax kicks in, adding three cents per gallon. One reason there are so many drivers this year, the poor state of airline service. Since Tuesday, more than two thousand flights have been canceled due to staffing shortages and weather.&lt;/p&gt;

But there won’t be freedom from the frustration and chaos that’s already piling up. Tonight, we can report with more than four hundred and forty flights were canceled, and more than thirty-two hundred delayed, that’s just today. Flight demand is returning to near pre-pandemic levels and so have the travel nightmares with airlines struggling with pilot and other staffing shortages. Airlines, you could say, are really facing a test on the eve of what’s going to be one of the busiest travel days. And if you want a sign of how it might go, the CEO of Delta Airlines is apologizing to customers. The situation so dire the company is taking employees with office jobs and sending them to the ticket counter to check bags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cancellations are stacking up across the country tonight, as US airlines continue to struggle to serve their own customers. Typically, fliers are concerned their flights won’t take off one time. But these days, more and more passengers are worried their flights won’t take off at all. At airports nationwide tonight, the holiday rush became holiday hurry up and wait. Airports are already seen a steady flow of passengers. The TSA reports more than two million have passed the checkpoints most days this month, as flight traffic approaches pre-pandemic levels. But airlines are struggling to meet demand. Since Memorial Day, airlines have canceled more than twenty-one thousand flights, double the rate of last year. In an effort to make up for some of that. American Airlines regional carriers are offering pilots three times their pay to pick up extra shifts. But United and Delta announced schedule reductions for July, sending these pilots to the &lt;strong&gt;picket&lt;/strong&gt; lines. Travelers who choose to drive instead of fly will face high prices at the pump. The national average is down since climbing over $5 per gallon two weeks ago but remains at $4.86, $1.75 higher than last year.&lt;/p&gt;

The close aid to then White House Chief of Staff M.M. Some of the revelations could land members of T’s inner circle and the former President himself in legal jeopardy. That includes H’s firsthand account of the former President encouraging his supporters to march to the Capitol. Even as he was told that many of them had weapons. With these developments eyes on the Justice Department for possible criminal charges. H’s testimony was breathtaking in scope and devastating in details including that presidential limo assault that she described. And tonight, we are hearing from the Secret Service about that. Tonight, the committee has subpoenaed the former White House counsel P.C. One day after testimony, C warned former President T of criminal exposure if he went to the Capitol on Jan.6th. Tonight, nevertheless there are new questions about whether the former President is exposed to criminal charges. The stunning revelations from former White House aid C.H have put the former President in greater legal jeopardy. Of note to the committee, the striking accusation T knew some of the crowds in DC were armed and likely headed toward an outnumbered police force in the Capitol. The potential charges, according to the legal experts, obstructing an official proceeding, the certification of the election and incitement of a riot. The President encouraging the crowd to march to the Capitol. Former federal prosecutor S.F said H’s testimony was a game changer and could prompt the Justice Department to act.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 06.28.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-06.28.22/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Jun 2022 19:27:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-06.28.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We are going to detail you the bombshell testimony today in the Jan.6th hearing. History is important. During the Watergate hearings fifty years ago, there was only one surprise witness. It was A.B who reviewed there was a White House taping system. Well, on the Jan.6th hearings, the surprise witness is C.H. Then Chief of Staff M.M top aide described then President fits of rage that included throwing plates of foods, grabbing the steering wheel of the presidential limo, and lunging at Secret Service agents. H said T was furious that Secret Service agents were keeping some of his supporters outside of the White House Ellipse because they had weapons. The other big news we learned today is that R.G and the President’s Chief of Staff sought pardons. That means we now know of at least nine individuals who sought pardons from President T in the final days of his term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The House Committee and this twenty-six-year-old former aid to the former White House Chief of Staff painted a powerful picture, beginning with the T White House ignoring warnings of looming violence at the capitol and ending with the chief of staff seeking that presidential pardon. When the day began, C.H was a name and face unknown to most Americans. By the end of the day, she made history including her description of an &lt;strong&gt;altercation&lt;/strong&gt; in the presidential limo when his chief Secret Service agent B.E refused to bring then President D.T to the US Capitol to which his just directed the crowd in Jan.6th. In the early hours that day, H said T was warned that people carrying weapons including guns descending on key landmarks in D.C. but that T sought to have the metal detectors removed concerned they’d reduced the size of his White House Ellipse crowd. As rioters began their attack, the President wouldn’t &lt;strong&gt;budge&lt;/strong&gt;. H said she asked her boss, former Chief of Staff, M.M to intervene.&lt;/p&gt;

An Amtrak train knocked on its side in a Missouri cornfield. At least three people were killed, and there are reports of numerous injuries. Officials say the train traveling from Los Angeles to Chicago with more than two hundred and fifty passengers and crew on board partially derailed after hitting a truck at a crossing. There are reports two boy scout troops were among the passengers. It happened in Mendon, Missouri, that’s a rural town of less than two hundred people. Weather at the time of crash does not appear to have been a factor. The wreck comes just weeks after the B administration announced more than $350 million dollars in grants to improve the infrastructure of the world’s largest and extensive rail system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Urgent cause of the derailment near Mendon, Missouri indicated several passengers were hurt. Amtrak says approximately two hundred and forty-three passengers and twelve crew were on board when the train barreled into the truck. This comes as an Amtrak passenger train struck a car on rail crossing in Northern California on Sunday. And in September, three passengers were killed when eight cars went off the trucks in Montana. Now late tonight, the NTSB says it’s sending a fourteen members Go Team to Missouri to determine what went wrong. Investigators will look into the trains braking system, its forwarding-facing cameras and its event data recorder. It picks up all sorts of components from the moving train.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fallout from the Supreme Court ruling about abortion rights is growing. This after three straight days of protests across America. The ruling has left some legal confusion. There is also a surge in demand for over-the-counter emergency contraceptive pills, forcing retailers like Walmart and CVS now to limit purchases.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 06.26.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-06.26.22/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jun 2022 19:20:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-06.26.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Advocates on both sides of abortion battle say their fight is not done. Anti-abortion rights forces are vowing to use Friday Supreme Court ruling, reversing fifty years of federal protection of abortion to push for near-total bans in every state. While abortion rights groups promise to harness anger in the streets, turning it into action at the ballot box this November. A new CBSN poll taken right after the court’s decisions finds most people disapprove of the decision to overturn Roe. A majority call it quotes “A step backward for America”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you’re seeing now is the legal fallout from this decision as states all over the country scrambled to figure out what exactly their laws on abortion are. Some are trying to &lt;strong&gt;enshrine&lt;/strong&gt; protections into their state constitutions, while others are trying to ensure the federal government doesn’t create a workaround for some of the strictest abortion bans in the country. With her state’s trigger law now locked into place, Republican governor K.N was asked if South Dakota would include exceptions for rape or incest. In Michigan, Democratic governor G.W is asking Supreme Court to clarify what applies. The current abortion law or ban that’s been dormant but on the books since the 1930s. According to a new CBSN poll out today, fifty-six of Americans think the overturn of Roe V Wade will make women’s lives worse and more than half say they think the Supreme Court is likely to put limits on gay marriage or access to birth control. At a rally in Illinois, former President D.T told the crowd that his work nominating conservatives justices made the ruling possible.&lt;/p&gt;

For some, it’s a moment of &lt;strong&gt;jubilation&lt;/strong&gt;. For others, a moment to vent their outrage. Today, demonstrators converged in cities across the country demanding to be heard. Thirteen states have laws on the books that ban abortion almost immediately. The others are poised to ban or greatly restrict it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, this clinic actually expanded hours today to try to accommodate as many women as possible before the attorney of general says they have to close their doors. And here has also been center stage for demonstrations, just the ones we’ve seen across the country. Large crowds returned to the streets of Los Angeles today. Across the country, the court’s ruling fueled tensions. In Cedar Rapids, Iowa, a pickup truck drove through abortion rights supporters, and in Washington DC, protests and celebrations. Here in Mississippi today, protesters gathered outside the state’s only abortion clinic. It’s at the very center of the Supreme Court case. The clinic, known as the “Pink House” could shut down in just weeks. Mississippi is one of the twenty-six states where abortion will soon be illegal. Thirteen of those states currently have laws would ban abortion immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, at the White House, the President signed to law the first major gun control legislation passed by Congress in nearly thirty years. The bipartisan compromise seemed unimaginable untill recent series of mass shootings, including Uvalde, Texas and Buffalo, New York. The President also criticized the Supreme Court&amp;rsquo;s recent ruling on guns and abortion, calling them &amp;ldquo;terrible decisions.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

As you can see behind me, demonstrators both for and against the court’s decision were quick to react in Washington and across the country. More than one hundred cities have already seen protests or planned to over weekend. Also reacting, some of the nation’s largest companies, announcing they will cover employee travel expenses for abortions if they are not available where they live. Some of those companies include Nike, Uber, Alaska Airlines, Citigroup, Conde Nast, Disney, JPMorgan, Microsoft, Warner Brothers, and CBS’s parent company Paramount Global. And we also heard from President past and present. President O called the ruling devastating, M.O called it horrifying. And President D.T said this gives the rights back to the states as it should have been long ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, Roe versus Wade is one the few decisions most Americans know by name. And today, the Supreme Court said, it’s history. When the crowd heard the court to overturn Roe versus Wade, there were cheers. A reality that for abortion right supporters was to believe. In the 5-4 vote, the justices overturned the landmark 1973 ruling that guaranteed a woman’s right abortion, sending the issue back to states to set their own policies. “Roes was egregiously wrong from the start. Its reasoning was exceptionally weak, and the decision has had damaging consequences.” Wrote Justice Samuel Alito in a decision joined by four other conservatives. “It’s time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people’s elected representatives.” Twenty-six states had asked the court to overturn Roe. Thirteen already have laws on the books that will ban abortion almost immediately. The others are poised to ban or greatly restrict it. On Capitol Hill, Democratic lawmakers marched to the court while Republicans said the ruling was overdue. It took almost fifty years of annual Marches for Life, political muscle and justices with a strong conservative’s legal ideology. Chief Justice J.R voted to uphold the fifteen-week Mississippi abortion ban but refused to join the majority’s decision to overturn Roe or subsequent 1992 opinion. With the court’s newest justices all nominated by former President T, there were five votes without him.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 06.23.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-06.23.22/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jun 2022 19:25:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-06.23.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;In the past few weeks, we’ve heard &lt;strong&gt;gripping&lt;/strong&gt; new testimonies from the Jan.6th hearings. But what we learned today was particularly &lt;strong&gt;egregious&lt;/strong&gt;. Three former high-level Justice Department officials testified that the President of the United States was repeatedly sought to pressure and manipulate the DOJ to, in the word of President T, just say the election was corrupt. And those officials told the President over and over again that there was no evidence of fraud, T sought replace to Attorney General with an environmental attorney with no experience. We also learned of an oval office show down on Jan.3rd that was just three days before the insurrection. The other big headline from Today’s hearing? That six House Republicans asked for pardons for themselves from the White House.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this appears to be another case of the former President ignoring advise from his own administration as he tried to pressure senior Justice Department officials to overturn 2020 election. Testifying under oath, top former Department of Justice officials told the House Select Committee investigating the Jan.6th attack that former President T relentlessly pressured them to investigate false claims of election fraud. Weaving previous interview with live testimony committee members painted a picture of a desperate President attempting to force former acting Attorney General J.R and his deputies to cast doubt on election integrity. Instead, J.C an environmental lawyer at DOJ with no experience in elections, wrote a draft letter that he intended to send to battleground states Trump lost, saying the Department had identified significant concerns that may impacted the outcome of the election. That was false. Three days before the Jan.6th attack on the Capitol, a tense hours-long oval office meeting took place where T threaten to replace R and C. J.C did not testify today, but invoked the Fifth Amendment at previous deposition. And yesterday, federal investigators raided his Northern Virginia home. Meantime, the committee named more Republican lawmakers who sought pardons after meeting with the former president to strategize ways to block the certification of the election.&lt;/p&gt;

President B hopes to suspending the Federal gas tax will help, but some economists aren’t so sure. The President needs the Congress to do it and we’re hearing tonight from members of both parties who aren’t so sure that this is a great idea. For his part the President says temporarily lifting the Federal gas tax would give Americans just a little bit of breathing room and he criticized the energy industries for prioritizing profits over production. The national average for a gallon of regular is now $4.96 and it’s $1.89 more than it was one year ago. And today the Fed Chair told Congress he’s trying to avoid a recession, but there is a possibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With gas prices bumping up against $5 a gallon, President is facing mounting pressure to do something. But the controversial move he proposed today, landed with a &lt;strong&gt;thud&lt;/strong&gt; on Capitol Hill and it’s not at all clear he has the votes. It’s a move that the White House has been &lt;strong&gt;mulling&lt;/strong&gt; from months, the President calling on Congress today to halt a key tax for three months. The typical small SUV with the fifteen-gallon gas tank, costs about $74 dollars to fill up right now, eliminating the gas tax, $0.18 per gallon would only bring that cost down by $2.7. And that’s assuming the gas station lower their prices to reflect the full tax cut. They’re under no obligation to do so. Lawmakers from both sides tapped the brakes today. To increase savings the White House is now urging states to cut their own gas taxes. A handful of states have already done so and analysts found a modest benefit for drivers. Another step, Energy Secretary is going to be sitting down tomorrow with oil companies’ CEOs to urge them to boost production, but some of these companies actually shut down refineries during the pandemic and as a result, US crude refining capacity actually is at its lowest level in eight years.&lt;/p&gt;

That’s because the head of Texas Department of Public Safety blasted the police’s response, detailing how there were enough armed officers in the school hallway, three minutes after the attack begin. But instead, officers waited seventy-four minutes before breaching what we’ve learned today was an unlocked door. S.M testified today in Austin that officers had the manpower, had the equipment and the time to quote “neutralize the suspect”. M placed the blame squarely on police chief P.A who was inside of the school but did not act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The head of Department of Public Safety in the fact that officers waited so long to react goes against everything they are ???. He said that in action set the profession back a decade. He also said the school police chief put the lives of officers over children. Colonel S.M, the head of Texas Department of Public Safety placed that blame solely at the boots of Uvalde school police chief, P.A. M laid out multiple times police failed to engage sooner. Three minutes into the attack, armed officers, two with rifles were present, including A. And at 11:52 AM, twenty-one minutes in, the first ballistic shield was inside of the school, confirming security footage obtained by the Austin American-Statesman. By 12:21 PM, officers with four ballistic shields heard more gun shots. Yet, police waited even as 911 calls were coming from at least two students inside the classrooms. P.A who was also in Austin at a close door hearing tried to dodge cameras and tough questions. A has claimed officers were looking for keys to open the classroom door. But M stunned lawmakers when he said the door didn’t lock from the inside and no one tried to open it. As more information come to life, Uvalde’s grief has turned to anger. A previously told media that officers didn’t have the firepower to stop the shooter. But M’s testimony contradicts that he says they did.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 06.20.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-06.20.22/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jun 2022 20:37:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-06.20.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, a beautiful day in New York City turned into a nightmare for people and the heart of Manhattan. Police say a yellow cab collided a cyclist before jumping the curb and then striking several people who were eating outside of a bagel shop. Authorities say a group of good Samaritans rushed to help. Six victims including taxi driver were taken into a hospital for treatment. Three people have life threatening injuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The horrific scene played out during a busy lunch hour on this holiday. You can still see the debris in front of that bagel shop where the taxi jumped the curb and plowed into a group of people. In just seconds, a bustling sidewalk in the city’s popular Flatiron District became a scene of carnage and chaos. This yellow taxi turned left and into Broadway and first struck a cyclist, then slowed down before jumping a curb and speeding up, &lt;strong&gt;careening&lt;/strong&gt; into a group of pedestrians. Police said the taxi pinned two women against a building wall. Witnesses said a woman was trapped under the car. In all, police said six people were hurt including the taxi driver. Bystanders quickly jumped in to help before a paramedics arrived. One witness said the cab driver crawled out of the car, and appeared disoriented. He was later treated at a hospital. Meantime, the police say that this may have been an accident, but the investigation continues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight, airliners are working to get back on track after another weekend of travel nightmare due to weather and staffing shortages. Airlines have canceled more than fifty-three hundred flights and delayed more than thirty-two thousand others since Thursday, leaving passengers frustrated and looking for answers.&lt;/p&gt;

The first Covid shot for children ages five and under are heading out the door a day after the director of the CDC signed off two vaccines. Here is the new CDC recommendation this weekend “all children six month and up should get vaccinated.” The first shot for the youngest will be available this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CDC director R.W says her staff is working over the Juneteenth holiday to make sure doses are available for children under the age of five as soon as Wednesday. Some of the parents we spoke say they are not sure what they are going to do. A sigh of relief for some parents on this Father’s Day. Covid 19 vaccinations will soon be available for millions of children under five. Eighteen million babies, toddlers and preschoolers are now eligible for the shot. Moderna’s vaccine is two doses one month apart. And for Pfizer, it’s three doses over the course of about three months. Today, former FDA commissioner Dr. Scott said low vaccination rates among children are still a concern. Some parents are already resisting the latest recommendations. In a recent survey, less than twenty percent of parents with young kids say they would have them vaccinated immediately. Thirty-eight percent plan to wait and see. Twenty-seven percent said they don’t intend to get their children vaccinated at all. For parents anxiously awaiting for the vaccine, there is hope the added protection will return a sense of normalcy to their lives. Now the B administration has been preparing for the rollout for weeks, allowing states, tribes, community health center and pharmacies to preorder millions of doses. Manufacturing companies can now begin shipping doses across the country.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 06.18.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-06.18.22/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jun 2022 19:10:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-06.18.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Millions of people are moving about the country this holiday weekend unless they been caught up in the mass flight cancellation mess. More than four thousand US flights have been canceled since Thursday hitting all regions of the country just as passenger traffic spikes. TSA reporting tonight it tallied more than 2.4 million flyers yesterday. That’s the highest number we’ve seen since Thanksgiving weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s been another frustrating weekend, another eight hundred flights canceled nationwide today. Now, Americans are relied on air travel during the busy summer travel season. But flying has become one of the most unreliable ways to travel. Friday was the biggest travel day of 2022. And for many, it was a travel nightmare. Hundred of delays and cancelations, passengers stranded, vacation ruined. At Boston’s Logan Airport, delayed travelers were left to take a nap on the airport floor. What was once a rare occurrence is becoming the norm. The airlines blamed pilots staffing shortages, coupled with unprecedented number of Americans flying. Add to it the bad weather this week, and you got a perfect storm. Transportation Secretary P.B met with Airlines’ CEO this week to urge them to improve the service, tweeting air travelers should be able to expect reliable service. Delta pilots published an open letter to passengers blaming management saying we have been working on our days off, flying a record amount of overtime to help you get to your destination. Experts say it could be months before staffing shortages improve meaning your summer travel plans maybe at the mercy of airlines. And by the way, fly hasn’t got any cheaper, in fact it’s about a hundred dollars more per tickets compared to last year.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 06.17.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-06.17.22/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Jun 2022 19:39:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-06.17.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;As we come on the air tonight, the State Department is scrambling for information on three Americans who’ve gone missing in the war in Ukraine. Their families are anxiously awaiting any news. All three served in the US military and traveled into the war zone to help the Ukrainians fight the Russians. Well today, Russian media showed video of two of the man A.D and A.H apparently in Russian custody. Well tonight, we are not going to play the audio on this video so as not to play into any propaganda. The pair vanished about a week ago in Eastern Ukraine where the fighting has been brutal. Russian forces are out to crush Ukrainian resistance and take control of the entire Donbass region. Well today President B says the US doesn’t know where the two men are and said Americans should stay out of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin says it doesn’t know anything about American prisoners in Russia. But members of their &lt;strong&gt;squadron&lt;/strong&gt; tell us images of them in Russian hands are undeniably real. They’re alive, but in Russia’s custody and forced to speak Russian. A member of their squad tells CBSN they are 100% certain the video and this photo are real all circulating in Russian media. CBSN spoke to another American who says he fought alongside D and W. He asked not to be identified. It may be Ukraine’s war, but more and more Americans are fighting in it. Now a third American fighter has gone missing on the frontlines. Retired Marine Captain G.K, a twenty-year veteran, reportedly disappeared after taking small arms fire in the Kherson region. For those captured, their fate rests in the hands of Russia where lawmakers are already discussing the death penalty.&lt;/p&gt;

There was powerful testimony from one of the most respected conservative lawyers in the Republican party, warning ominously that the threat to the democracy isn’t over. And the former President D.T and his allies present quote, “a clear and present danger in 2024.” Former Federal Judge M.L said Vice President M.P prevented what would have been a revolution within a constitutional crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The committee detailed the unprecedented pressure campaign against M.P, which ignited crowds, some of whom, the committee says, were willing to kill P. The &lt;strong&gt;riotous&lt;/strong&gt; mob got within forty feet of an evacuating M.P. P’s lawyer, G.J was with him, at least some willing to murder according to the committee and an FBI informant. The committee contended the mob was egged on by a tweet from D.T saying P lacked courage. New images showed P hiding in an underground safe room. The committee also showed T in oval office on the morning of Jan. 6th when he put final pressure on P to block certification of the election in an explosive phone call. His aides say P never considered the scheme devised by California lawyer J.E to have the former Vice President rejected the electors and throw the election to Trump. The committee said even Trump’s chief of staff and E himself knew the plan was &lt;strong&gt;bogus&lt;/strong&gt; and dangerous. Former White House lawyer E.H said he warned E. During the hearing, there was a letter released, sent by the Justice Department to the Jan. 6th committee asking the committee for copies of all the transcripts from all their interviews. The committee won’t comment, but in the letter the Justice Department says it needs those transcripts to prosecute more Jan. 6th criminals.&lt;/p&gt;

The rate increase was a quarter of a percentage point and the central bank also signaled there will be a similar increase when they meet again at the end of July. Wall Street expected the big increase and all three indexes jumped today with the official announcement. But what it means to the average consumer is still an open question. The goal here is to slow the economy without causing a recession. As consumer prices skyrocket on everything from rents to groceries to gas prices, the Fed hopes to make it more expensive to borrow money means people will spend less on things like homes and cars leading to a drop in demand. And as we know from the gas station, fuel is pricy. So, President B today was &lt;strong&gt;scolding&lt;/strong&gt; US oil companies for taking advantage of the crisis to make record profits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this rate hike, the Fed signaled its mean this growing inflation head on. It’s a bold attempt to throw cold water on a white-hot economy. The aggressive move from Central Bank today is urgent, according to Fed Chair J.P. The last time the Fed raised rates ¾ of a percent was in 1994 when inflation was only 2.7%. The Fed’s move today will make borrowing money more expensive. With rate hikes one and half percent already this year, a loan for the average new car price of $47000 will cost almost $60 a month more interest than last year. More expensive loans could discourage spending and reduce the &lt;strong&gt;insatiable&lt;/strong&gt; demand now driving inflation to forty-years highs. But higher interest rates won’t lower gas prices, now over five dollars per gallon nationally. Today, President B called on seven US oil refiners to ramp up production and stop making historically high profit off Americans. The painful price increases are already too much for some people on fixed incomes.&lt;/p&gt;

Excessive heat watches and warnings are effective in more than a dozen states and more than a hundred and seventy million Americans will see temperatures above 90 degrees. Flooding across parts of Montana and Wyoming forced the closure of Yellow Stone National Park just as the summer tourist season is kicking in ??? the year. Wildfires in Arizona and California forced thousands to evacuate. And in the Midwest, severe storms damaged buildings and downed trees and knocked out power to thousands in the Chicago area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the humidity, it feels like a hundred and seven degrees, and that’s not a conjecture, that is the heat index. This is tale of two cities, last night, we had torrential rain and tornado warnings, today the sun is out with dangerous heat. Outside, there is no place to hide, but Chicago is desperate to cool off a flop ??? to Lake Michigan. The extreme heat could be deadly, with at least fifteen thousand people in Chicago area out of power and air conditioning because of this super ??? thunderstorm pushed through the area last night, triggering a tornado warning in the nation’s third largest city. The high winds peeled the roof off this three-storeyed apartment building. Wind gusts as high as ninety-eight miles per hour slammed into Fort Wayne, Indiana ??? a hole into this airport &lt;strong&gt;hangar&lt;/strong&gt;. Today, in Milwaukee, the body of a ten-year-old boy was found after he got swiped away in a drainage ditch during the downpour. Two adults went after him and were also pulled under. At Yellowstone national park, torrential rains pushed the river to nearly fourteen feet, the highest ever recorded. Major flooding even swapped away homes, washing out bridges and forcing evacuations. There is little relief out West, where a wildfire forced evacuations near Flagstaff, Arizona, fueled by strong winds and dry grass. Back here in Chicago, officials are urging each other to check on themselves, check on their neighbors and go to cooling centers if needed. Now there are people here like we mentioned that don’t have power, don’t have AC and nationwide roughly six hundred thousand people are out of power due to these storms.&lt;/p&gt;

Investors begin week hitting the sell button thanks to rising inflation and fragile economy. The DOW was downed more than 2% on the day, NASDAQ dropped more than 4% and the S&amp;amp;P sank more than 3%. The S&amp;amp;P finished the day in a bear market. The last time that happened was at the start of the pandemic. And for those invested in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, well that crypto market crashed today, wiping out billions of dollars. It all comes ahead of a closely watched Federal Reserve meeting this week, with the central bank is all but sure to raise interest rates. And it’s possible the benchmark rate could be raised even higher than forecasted going up by seventy-five bases points. That could be the biggest hike in more than two decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The market’s nose dive today from the start of trading sending investors scrambling. It’s a sharp reversal for stock market which has seen the record highs during pandemic, and now has some economists fearing a looming recession. The closing bell saved the market from tumbling further. The S&amp;amp;P 500 led the decline today, falling to its lowest point this year with investors coming to terms the consumer prices rising at their fastest pace in forty years. The drop is the latest in the stream of downturns for the markets. Tech companies took the brunt, Amazon lost sixty billion in market value, Apple more than eighty-five billion, pulling the NASDAQ deeper into bear market territory. The &lt;strong&gt;volatility&lt;/strong&gt; is a hit to people’s 401Ks while inflation is also pummeling consumers. Average gas prices were topping $5 per gallon nationwide according to AAA. And at the grocery store, food prices are up 10%, adding to the uncertainty is just how aggressive the Federal Reserve will be in trying to cool the white-hot cost of living. More economists are expecting a bigger move, three quarters of a point, the biggest interest rate hike since 1994.&lt;/p&gt;

A bipartisan group of Senators announced they had struck a deal to quote “protect the Americans, children, keep our schools safe and reduce the threat of violence across the country”. Theirs proposals are modest but do represent some movement. It’s a response to the massacre in Uvalde, Texas claimed the lives of nineteen children and two teachers. And prior to that, the murder of 10 people at the grocery store in Buffalo, New York.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This framework falls far short of what advocates would have like to see. But President B says this could be the most significant gun legislation to pass Congress in decades. With pressure from gun reform activists across the country, today, a group of Senators including ten Republicans announced a framework to address gun violence after years of inaction to tighten gun laws. The proposal includes enhanced background checks for gun buyers under twenty-one, incentives for states to implement Red Flag laws and funding for mental health services. In a written statement, the Senators said their plan, quote “saves lives while protecting the constitutional rights of law-abiding Americans”. On the other side of the capital this week, the House Committee investigating the January 6th attack holds another round of hearings, focusing Monday on former President T’s disinformation campaign. Another issue at hand, will the Justice Department charge the former President with a federal crime?&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 06.11.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-06.11.22/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Jun 2022 20:06:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-06.11.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The United States accounts for 4% of the world’s population, but nearly 10% of gun murders. People of color are disproportionately impacted. Today, thousands rallied nationwide, demanding Congress act now. They gathered with March for Our lives. The organization was formed in aftermath of the Parkland School shooting in 2018. Organizers say there were more than fifty rallies across the US. The largest in Washington DC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it’s been four years since thousands of people rallied here in Washington calling lawmakers to keep them safe away from gun violence in everyday places. Well today, they were back, frustrated and with the same message. Emotional, impassioned ralliers say now is the time for action. People from across the country gathered at the National Mall for the second March for Our Lives demanding gun control legislation on every level. The lawmakers say they’re making progress, we know they met virtually yesterday. Senator C.M of Connecticut who is leading the charge of passing tougher measures says while he is for compromise, he doesn’t want to just check any sort of box unless that means this bill will save lives. Senators will back here on the Hill on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first time ever, the average price of gas nationwide has hit an unprecedented $5 per gallon. But for drivers in California, that price is still a bargain.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 06.10.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-06.10.22/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Jun 2022 19:29:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-06.10.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Prices are skyrocketing on everything from food to fuel and from rent to airfare. But the numbers are worse than expected. Inflation is surging at the fastest pace in more than forty years, with the consumer price index raising 8.6 percent compared to a year earlier. It’s actually the fastest pace of inflation since December 1981. &lt;strong&gt;Rampant&lt;/strong&gt; inflation is not only imposing severe pressure on our pocket books but also on President B. Recent survey show Americans see high inflation as the nation’s top problem as the President’s approval ratings on the economy remain underwater. Stocks fell sharply on the news, with the DOW and S&amp;amp;P 500 falling more than 2%. The tech-heavy NASDAQ fell more than 3%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CBSN has learned the White House didn’t anticipate the inflation number would be this big. And the figures are rattling the Democrats ahead of the Midterm Elections as voters are holding President B responsible for something he alone can’t fix. Today’s record inflationary report means more economic pain ahead for Americans. And Wall Street felt it too as the market tumbled. Costs are up for food, rent and used cars and of course gas, which is up almost 50% from a year ago. American household are now paying $460 more every month to buy the same things they did last year. President B visited the Port of Los Angeles, the backlog of idling ships and cargo containers has eased but had little effect on record prices. Inflation is now a full-blown political crisis for the White House and Democrats heading into the Midterm Elections. Eight in ten Americans say the economy is in bad shape. And consumer confidence today hit a new low. It’s now up to the Federal Reserve, which is likely boost interest rate in hopes of pushing down prices. Here in LA today, the President also called on the oil industry to boost domestic production and warned against price gouging. He also wants Congress to pass legislation that would ease shipping costs so they don’t pass along onto customers. But at this point, that’s about all he can do.&lt;/p&gt;

The first prime-time hearing for the committee investigating January 6th attack. Congressional aids tell us we’ll see new evidence tonight that shows the assault on the US Capital was coordinated and planned effort to overturn the results of the 2020 Presidential Election. And that former President Donald Trump was at the center of it all. Tonight’s hearing is the first of several planned public hearings that will layout the results of a nearly yearlong investigation including more than one thousand interviews and more than one hundred and forty thousand documents. The stunning images from that day will forever marked the darkest days of American democracy. At least five police officers dead as a result of the attack, and more than one hundred and forty police officers were injured. The criminal investigation has spanned nearly all fifty states with more than eight hundred people charged for their alleged roles in the attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight, the select committee will unveil some of its findings after a nearly a yearlong investigation. Chairman B.T stating at the &lt;strong&gt;outset&lt;/strong&gt; that what happened on January 6th can be swapped under the rug, warning the conspiracy to thwart the will of the people is not over.

A military Osprey aircraft has crashed in California with reports of five service members on board. We’re gathering the late breaking details right now. The House of Representatives just voted on a package of gun control measures that would tighten the nation’s gun laws in response to the recent mass shootings. Democrats wanted to put Republicans on the record with these eight measures everything from raising purchasing age for semiautomatic weapons to limiting magazine sizes. And even though the bills have passed the democratically controlled House, they won’t make it through the Senate instead there, a bipartisan group is working on a narrow bill which critics say won’t change much. The lead up to these votes was heartbreaking testimony from fourth grade survivor and from parents of a ten-year-old who was killed in Uvalde.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the debate over how to combat gun violence intensifies here in Capital Hill, many lawmakers were forced to confront the human toll that is taking by listening to a young girl who has the courage and instinct to save her own life. This was the moment fourth grader, M.C relived the nightmare of a gunman entering her classroom at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas. Tonight, the House is voting on a package of gun restrictions that include raising the purchasing age to 21 for semiautomatic weapons and banning high-capacity magazines but most Republicans oppose it calling it &lt;strong&gt;reactionary&lt;/strong&gt; and unconstitutional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the weapon of choice in both Uvalde and Buffalo mass shootings were an AR-15 style rifle. According to a leading gun industry group, there are approximately twenty million of these weapons particularly in the US. And tonight, in a CBSN investigation, we take a look at how gun makers marketing these assault style weapons for young people.&lt;/p&gt;

Oscar awarding-winning actor and Uvalde native M.M gave one of the emotionally powerful speeches about gun laws that we’ve ever seen at the White House. This after visiting Robb Elementary School in his hometown where nineteen kids and two teachers were killed. M. talked about growing up at Uvalde where he learned responsible gun ownership and he said now is the windows of opportunity where real change can happen. And the reminder of gun violence epidemic in this country is on display not far from the White House. More than forty-five thousand flowers on the National Mall to represent the number of Americans who died from gun violence each year. And the threat of more violence is real. Just today, Department of Homeland Security releasing a threat bulletin warning of copycat attacks this summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The White House briefing room is typically a pretty &lt;strong&gt;raucous&lt;/strong&gt; place. But today, for a about twenty minutes, you could’ve heard a pin drop as M.M spoke about a cause that has suddenly become personal and begged Washington to act. But that argument has not swayed most Republican leaders. In fact, just today, they announced their opposition to a red flag bill in the House that would allow guns to be taken away from people pose a risk to themselves or to others. Those Republicans say that such a bill will &lt;strong&gt;trample&lt;/strong&gt; on Americans’ Second Amendment rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The emotional pleas to stop the tide of gun violence were heard on Capital Hill today. The families of the victims of the hate-fueled Buffalo mass shooting added their voices to the call for a reform.&lt;/p&gt;

At least seventeen people were killed and nearly seventy other injured in the shootings from Philadelphia to Chattanooga, from Grand Rapids, Michigan, to Somerton, South Carolina. The rise in gun violence and mass shootings seems to be impacting every community across the country. There have been two hundred and forty-six mass shootings so far in just this year while today is just a hundred and fifty seventh day of the year. And the last month shootings have taken place at churches, grocery stores, doctor’s offices and elementary schools. According to the Gun Violence Archive, more than seven hundred children under the age of eighteen had been killed by firearms so far this year. And this follows data from the CDC showing that for the first time in history, firearms were the leading cause of death for the children in the US in 2020. So, when will Congress and lawmakers do something about the violence?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can hear behind me, people are simply fed up with the gun violence here in Philadelphia. Just this passed Saturday that hundreds of people were gathered here along South Street of a very popular section of the city when the shooting broke out. Well, today we learned that police have made one arrest and as many shootings we covered in the past, we’re hearing more calls for action, more worry about the future. What started in Philadelphia as a confrontation with words quickly turned physical then deadly. The gunfire, the screaming, the panic ended with three people dead and eleven others injured. It was just one of several mass shootings this weekend. Philadelphia’s district attorney L.C calls what’s happening in the city heartbreaking. It’s a country more recently awash in shootings. In Chicago which leads the US gun violence, at least thirty-two people were shot and five people were killed. In Tennessee, gunfire outside a nightclub claimed the lives of two people while fourteen others were wounded. Some residents are now wondering whether it will ever be safe go out again. In South Carolina and Texas, shootings at graduation parties killed one person and injured a dozen others including a twelve-year-old.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 06.05.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-06.05.22/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Jun 2022 19:16:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-06.05.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight marking yet another weekend of deadly gun violence across the America. The latest mass shooting happening in big cities and small from Philadelphia to Chattanooga to Socorro, Texas. At least six people have been killed, more than two dozen others wounded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This weekend’s violence comes as cities across the nation honored national gun violence awareness weekend hoping to prevent the very tragedies many communities are dealing with now. Philadelphia police are investigating whether this fight captured on cellphone video led to a mass shooting in one of the city’s most popular gathering places. Three people were killed and twelve other injured after authority say multiple shooters fired into a crowd of people. Officers stationed nearby engaged the gunman as they ran from the scene. In Chattanooga, Tennessee, investigators believe a mass shooting near a night club led three dead and fourteen injured. Cities across the country are grappling with mass shooting this weekend. Today, Uvalde, Texas, another funeral service held for a victim of the elementary school massacre. Ten-year-old A.R dreamed of one day attending art school in Paris. The growing thread of violence has Americans on edge. Fears over a possible active shooter sent shoppers running for cover at two New York City malls during the weekend. Investigators now believe fireworks may have sent off the panic. And this is the second consecutive weekend in Brooklyn where crowds scramble for cover after hearing some sort of loud noise. Those experiencing panic say there is trauma in the aftermath of several mass shootings.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 06.04.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-06.04.22/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Jun 2022 21:53:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-06.04.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with the latest on the nationwide baby formula shortage. Today, Abbott, the largest baby formula manufacture announced that production has resumed at its plant in Sturgis, Michigan for the first time since February. But boosting supplies in stores is a whole other matter. It’s an urgent matter for parents and more recently, for the President. The reopening of that plant is significant. But it’s not an immediate fix. Abbott says it’s going to start with what it calls special metabolic formulas. And those go to doctors and hospitals, not directly to consumers. So, you won’t see them on stores’ shelves. Meanwhile, across the country almost seventy-four percent of those shelves are empty. Ten states are nearly ninety percent out of baby formula. The B administration says it’s doing everything it can. Last night, the President tweeted US has secured another thirty-three million bottles of formula from Nestle, that means a hundred and twenty-seven million bottles are heading to stores soon. But when that factory does start back up production of more standard direct to consumer formula, it&amp;rsquo;s going to take several weeks before you see it in the grocery store. And that’s not going to help moms and dads and families who need to feed those infants right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the Bs were whisked away to a fire station to wait while this small aircraft made an incursion into the restricted airspace above their beach house. Now the Secret Service says the pilot wasn’t answering on the radio, the plane was escorted out of the area. A CBSN producer saw fighter jets nearby. Secret Service says there was no immediate threat to the First Families, precautions were taken, and they are interviewing the pilot, just to be safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To South Florida now where a storm dumped nearly a foot of rain causing widespread flash flooding and danger.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 06.03.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-06.03.22/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Jun 2022 20:38:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-06.03.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, a major storm system is bearing down on Florida as the Atlantic hurricane season gets underway. The system is expected to make landfall around noon tomorrow. But it’s already lashing Cuba with &lt;strong&gt;torrential&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;downpours&lt;/strong&gt;. Two people were killed in Havana with flooding turns streets to raging rivers. In Florida, life threatening flash flooding is the main concern as parts of the Miami could see more than a half foot of rain. Strong winds and huge waves are currently battering the southern east as residents flee to safer areas inland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re spending our evening the way we started our morning with scattered showers that have just been coming on through. It’s interesting the pattern that’s beginning to set up. Well, the torrential rain that will come through, a little bit of a &lt;strong&gt;respite&lt;/strong&gt; in the action. The winds return, and then the rain once again follows. Now, in this area we have had some &lt;strong&gt;sporadic&lt;/strong&gt; power outages. We could see more of those as we move forward in time. But if you take a look at the size of the system, as it makes its way through, it’s going to be really a rainmaker. That’s going to be the number one threat. In fact, if you take a look at the radar, future radar shows that we have this shield moisture that is lifting up from parts of the Gulf of Mexico, eventually making its way to the Florida coastline. We’re seeing parts of it right now. But by the time all is said and done, we could see anywhere from, say, 6 to perhaps even 8 inches of rainfall. But keep in mind there is also a chance we could see some of these bands that come onshore overperforming with possibly up to ten inches of rainfall. So, flooding not just possible, could a reality by the time we get to the early morning hours and round out the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

The President made an impassioned plea calling on lawmakers to pass common sense gun laws. Fifty-six candles on the President’s walk to the podium that presenting all fifty states and six territories are impacted. In less than three weeks, ten people were killed in Buffalo, New York, twenty-one killed in Uvalde, Texas including nineteen children and then last night’s hospital shooting in Tulsa, Oklahoma that killed four. So far this year, US has seen two hundred and thirty-three mass shootings. The last time Congress passed a major piece of Federal gun legislation was nearly thirty years ago, with the assault weapons ban, well that expired in 2004. The AR-15 style weapon is the choice for the deadliest mass shootings in America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The President tonight said he is trying to take away firearms from legal gun owners merely trying to protect children. And he endorsed ongoing bipartisan talks to find a solution. Addressing the nation tonight, just over twenty-four hours after the latest mass shooting, President B called for a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. Mr. B endorsed ongoing talks in the Senate about possible gun reforms appear to have momentum. Maine Republican S.C says the group is making rapid progress toward a common-sense package. But the negotiations aren’t focused on possible weapons ban, instead on improving background checks and so-called red flag laws that keep guns from people who could harm themselves or others. House democrats today continue crafting their own gun reform legislation. A bill that’s poised to get a vote next week will raise the age to buy semi-automatic weapons from eighteen to twenty-one and ban large capacity gun magazines. Six of nine deadliest mass shootings since 2018 carried out by people twenty-one or younger. Now it’s important to point out while the House wants to pass that legislation next week, there’s currently no path forward for it in the evenly divided Senate. That’s why the White House and lawmakers know, any breakthrough will have to come from Republicans and Democrats in the Senate trying to cut a deal.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 06.01.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-06.01.22/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Jun 2022 10:22:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-06.01.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We’re going to begin with the news that is just coming into us that many parents will welcome. Infants, toddlers and preschoolers are one step closer to get a Covid vaccine. Pfizer just submitted its application and data to the FDA, the final thing needed before the agency to authorize its Covid shot for kids as young as six months old. That’s the only group of Americans that is not yet eligible to get a shot. Pfizer says the vaccine is safe and kids handle the three doses well. The company says its regimen is eighty percent of effective preventing children from getting sick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are about twenty million children under the age of five in the US. And if the FDA give these new Pfizer vaccines emergency use authorization, those kids could have shots by the end of summer. As much of the country return to normal, life for A.F and her family have remained anything but. F’s seven-year-old daughter is fully vaccinated. But like millions of Americans, her two-year-old has been ineligible for a vaccine. As a result, they avoid most indoor activities, but help could be on the way. In preliminary data, Pfizer said it vaccine for children age six-month-old to five years is about eighty percent effective, the dose is one tenth strength of the adult version. And three shots are required. Moderna has already submitted its request for emergency use authorization for a similar age group. The FDA is meeting at June 14th and 15th to review both Pfizer and Moderna data. Moderna says its two-shot regimen is fifty one percent effective after of preventing illness in children age six months to two and thirty seven percent of effective in kids age two to five.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 05.31.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-05.31.22/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jun 2022 19:34:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-05.31.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, the community of Uvalde, Texas begins saying goodbye to the victims of last week’s horrific shooting at Robb Elementary School. Hundreds of mourners turn out for the first of twenty-one funerals to take place in the weeks ahead. As the city tries to come to determine of what happened in their small town. The anger and anguish of parent’s float around the nation. And we are learning more about the investigation tonight including this reversal: Police originally said the gunman got into the after a teacher propped opened door, we’re now learning that door was closed but did not lock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just heard from Texas Department of Public Safety that that school’s police chief, the man in charge of police response has not responded to a request by the Texas rangers made two days ago for a follower interview to get some answers, that is the agency that’s investigating the shooting. The silver coffin was carried into sacred church in Uvalde, Texas today, inside, the body of ten-year-old A.J.G. The first funeral of the twenty-one people killed last Tuesday at Robb Elementary School. Later tonight, M.R. will be laid to rest. The family said, she wanted to be a Marine biologist. Nineteen of the victims are to be buried in a specially designed caskets made and donated by a nearby Texas business. Including forty-four-year-old teacher A.M whose sister has the impossible task of picking the dress she will be buried in. As the reality sets in, so does the anger on local law enforcement. The community which initially questioned why these police waited about seventy-five minutes before killing the shooter is now demanding answers.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 05.30.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-05.30.22/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jun 2022 19:12:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-05.30.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, the nation pauses to remember the heroes, veterans and gold star families who served and sacrifice for our freedom. This afternoon, the President laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery. Less than twenty-four hours earlier, the President was in Texas, visiting the families of the nineteen children and two teachers who were killed in an elementary school shooting last week. Tonight, the community of Uvalde is preparing for the victims’ funerals, and the Justice Department has announced it will conduct a critical incidental review of the police response to the massacre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last week, I’ve been talking to children who served the shooting and parents and they tell me they can’t think of a scarier thought than the end of the summer when they have to come back to school. Well, they may not have to come into this building at least. During his visit yesterday, President B vowed to do everything he can to have the school demolished and rebuild. Mourners gathered at this funeral home just steps from Robb Elementary School. It’s the same building that the gunman initially began shooting before his deadly attack on the school. Today, it’s where a grieving community attended visitation for A.J.G. Also remembered today, M.R, the first for the twenty-one killed last week. The Department of Justice, at the request of Uvalde mayor, announced it will conduct a review of the police response to the shooting. But noted it is not a criminal investigation. Police are trained to confront an active shooter immediately. Yet as angry parents begged for help. The on-scene police commander gave instructions to wait despite multiple 911 calls from children who were trapped inside. A Federal tactical team took it upon themselves to storm in about seventy-five minutes later.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 05.29.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-05.29.22/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 May 2022 17:11:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-05.29.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;For the second time in less than two weeks, President B and the First Lady are consoling communities gutted by gun violence. The ??? all too familiar Mr. and Dr. B met with grieving relatives, listening to their sorrow and anger. This comes as federal government launches a review of the ??? police response to the shooting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thousands of people waited in line in ninety-nine-degree heat to pay their respect to this memorial. They also want accountability for law enforcement and lawmakers. President B and the First Lady brough flowers at Robb Elementary in Uvalde, Texas, the site of the second deadliest elementary school shooting in US history. At memorial, Dr. J.B was seen landed her hands on the pictures of the children that were murdered. From there, the Bs attended mass??? With the crowd gathered outside urged the President to do something. The first family’s visit comes as the Department of Justice announced a review of the police response to the shooting that killed two teachers and nineteen children. The review will provide independent account of law enforcement actions during the massacre. Parents in this community are demanding after they learned that as many as nineteen officers including a federal tactical team waited outside the classrooms for more than forty minutes before confronting and killing the shooter. Several funerals for the twenty-one victims will have later on this week, but residents here say, it’ll take much longer to heal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, gun violence continues this weekend, four cities suffered mass shooting Saturday along, killing at least two people, injuring dozen.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 05.28.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-05.28.22/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 May 2022 16:38:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-05.28.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, no adjective can capture the level of anger &lt;strong&gt;emanating&lt;/strong&gt; from Uvalde, Texas. Today, families are trying to process the news of authorities waited before entering the classroom where a gunman took twenty-one lives in the nation’s twenty seventh school shooting so far this year. Today, in his commencement address of the University of Delaware, President B remembered the young lives lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thousands of people have streamed into this park in Uvalde, they cried together, they prayed together. And they’re also asking questions, the biggest one? Why officers took so long to stop the shooter. Song of salvation makes sorrow today, as the small community in Uvalde, Texas came together after being ripped apart by Tuesday’s massacre. While hundreds of residents praying for strength, investigators are still looking answers into Uvalde School Police Chief A’s decision to not allow a border patrol tactical team to confront the shooter for more than forty minutes while students and teachers inside a classroom called 911. We asked the social networking at Yubo about reports the suspect threatening raise a school shooting in its platform. Yubo responded “Due to active investigation by law enforcement, we cannot publicly share details on an individual user’s data at this time”. We’re also hearing from the shooter’s mother: “I have no words. I have no words to say because I don’t know what he was thinking”.&lt;/p&gt;

Today we learned that the officer in charge at the time of the shooting ordered law enforcement not to enter the classroom where children were being terrorized by a gunman. Those children were repeatedly calling 911 begging for police officers to help while other officers waited nearby. But the commander in charge believed the gunman had barricaded himself and was no longer in active shooting. It was a deadly decision. All this was taken place as desperate parents outside of the school pleaded with the police to intervene. The Texas governor tonight said he was misled about the police response and is &lt;strong&gt;livid&lt;/strong&gt;. Now there is an investigation into not only the gunman but how police were responded to the massacre. And of course, for the families of victims, this news is causing even more heart break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the governor is livid imagine those parents who learned today that there were nineteen officers outside that classroom. One officer for every child was killed. I heard from three parents today who said they will do whatever it takes for accountability and gun control. Today, a stunning admission. The Director of Texas Department of Safety said the decision to not immediately engage the shooter was deliberate. At one point he said nineteen officers were outside the classroom, not moving on the gunman. Inside, a desperate child repeatedly called 911 pleading them for come in and save them. It’s unclear how many of those eight or nine children survive. Fingers are now being pointed at the school district chief of police whom M said instructed tactical teams from border patrol and ICE to wait nearly forty minutes. The revelation on the failure to act sooner comes after frantic parents stood outside the school during the shooting begging heavily armed officers outside to help as their children were trapped by the gunman. We’re also learning more details on how the gunman got inside. He crashed his car outside just before 11:30 AM and fired into the school. The school resource officer not in school at the time. He would fire more than one hundred rounds from his AR-15 style rifle inside the school. Tonight, Texas governor G.A who earlier praised the police response, changing his tune.&lt;/p&gt;

A spokesperson for the Texas Department of Public Safety said that the gunman walked into the school through an unlocked side door and was inside a classroom for more than an hour before a tactical team stormed into the building and take him out. These new details came after videos emerged from during the shooting showing parents desperate, begging officers to enter the building and rescue their children. And the massacre has reignited a national debate over the country’s gun laws. As we learned tonight that President B and the First Lady will travel here on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s raising even more questions tonight about the response by police during what was an active shooter situation. Authorities tonight confirming the gunman was in the elementary school for an hour or more before he was shot and killed. The anguished cries of desperate parents after the massacre at Robb Elementary School pleading with police to rescue their children. Tonight, Texas investigators going public with a new timeline as they face criticism, they didn’t move quickly enough. Authorities say the gunfire then slowed considerably. An hour later, CBSN has learned, an elite border patrol team moving behind a shield entered the classroom and killed the suspect. Today, would have been their last day of school. Tonight, their names are on white crosses posted outside of it. And it won’t be part of the official death count, but it is part of the toll of this horrific event.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 05.25.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-05.25.22/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 May 2022 19:21:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-05.25.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, we’re here in Uvalde, Texas, a community shattered by one of the deadliest school shootings in America’s history. Twenty-one victims, nineteen of them innocent children they ranged in age from ten down to as young as 8. One victim described by family as the sweetest little boy I’ve ever known, so full of life. Others loved baseball, loved swimming, loved dancing to TikTok videos. In other words, these are your everyday American kids, extraordinarily loved and now extraordinarily missed. Their parents tonight adjusting to a new reality to the lives that we all know will never quite be the same. And now, there’re roughly fifteen thousand person predominately Latino community is also added to the list of places you know by heart, Columbine, Newtown, Parkland, places scarred by gun violent, their children murdered in their own classroom. And of course, the question tonight, when it will stop?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New details emerging tonight on how this massacre unfolded and they’re chilling, the gunman firing at a classroom full of fourth graders and their teachers. They had just been celebrating the end of school year. But suddenly, they were trapped with nowhere to go. Massacre in a fourth-grade classroom, just two days before summer break. A gunman bursting into a fourth-grade classroom at Robb Elementary School, opening fire with an AR-15 style rifle. And unimaginable toll, nineteen children gunned down along with two teachers. Seventeen others were hurt. Among those who did not come home, A.G who proudly displayed her honor roll certificate and more. CBSN has learned the gunman, Salvador Ramos had earlier fought with his grandmother over a cell phone bill and shot her in the face. Tonight, she is in critical condition. The shooter sent private online messages about thirty minutes before reaching the school. A border patrol agent from an elite SWAT unit shot and killed him a short time later. The gunman dropped out of school and had few friends authorities say. Legally purchased two assault rifles and almost four hundred rounds of ammunition earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 05.24.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-05.24.22/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 May 2022 18:31:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-05.24.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, another mass shooting in America, this time in an elementary school where at least fourteen children and a teacher were killed. On the brink of summer vacation, lives in the small town of Uvalde, Texas changed forever. This is the deadliest school shooting since the Stoneman Douglas high school shooting in Parkland, Florida in 2018. Police said the shooting happened at 11:32 AM local time at Robb Elementary school in South Texas. Texas governor G.A says the suspect gunman entered the school with a handgun and possibly a rifle and was likely shot by a responding officer. The FBI and the Department of Homeland Security are involved in the investigation. Flag s have been lowered to half-staff, and the White House says the President will address the nation at 8:15 PM Eastern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CBSN can confirm the suspect not only had a handgun but also an assault rifle. Witnesses describe a chaotic scene and reports of relatives rushing to the school to pull out second, third, and fourth graders at their classroom windows. Police say just before noon, a gunman walked into Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas and started shooting. A says the gunman was a senior at a nearby high school and he shot his grandmother before entering the elementary. Within minutes, heavily armed police rushed to the scene and confronted the shooter. Thirteen children were transported to the hospital for treatment. Witnesses say frantic parents were rushed to the school. Two victims, a child and an adult were flown to San Antonio hospital. CBSN has also learned that multiply patrol agents were responded to the school shooting. One CBP agent has been shot in the head, that agent is at local hospital receiving medical treatment and remains in stable condition. This shooting comes a little over a week after ten people were killed in a mass shooting at a Buffalo supermarket. Police say the motive is unknown at this time and the investigation is ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 05.23.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-05.23.22/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 May 2022 18:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-05.23.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, help for some America’s most vulnerable babies is on the way. But for many families, those store shelves are still missing the formula they need to feed their children. An Air Force cargo plane with thirty-nine tons of hypoallergenic formula landed in Indiana yesterday. And a second flight from Germany will arrive in Virginia on Wednesday. These are the first two flights of Operation Fly Formula as B administration works to ease a nationwide shortage. Meanwhile, regulators in Abbott Nutrition hope to reopen the company’s shuttered Michigan plant next week. But it could take up to two months before that formula is available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As desperate families nationwide wait for baby formula to arrive, here in New York City, the mayor issued a state of emergency to prevent price gouging. This massive Air Force C-17 plane landed in the US Sunday, carrying precious cargo, seventy-eight thousand pounds of hypoallergenic formula from Switzerland. The shipment of formula is enough to feed twenty-seven thousand babies and toddlers with an allergy to cow’s milk, about half a million bottles for a week. This batch will not go to store shelves, but instead, hospitals and Doctor’s offices in the most impacting regions. In forty-three states, more than forty percent of formula products were recently out of stock. This comes as Abbott, the largest maker of formula in the country, apologized for worsening the shortage saying “We’re sorry to every family we’ve let down”. The company’s CEO says it expects to resume production at its Michigan plant by the first week of June, and in full production by the end of the month. Getting more formula on store shelves will take ramping up production here at home. The White House has moved two formula makers to the front line for raw ingredients that were held up in the supply chain. Vital ingredients that will help Abbott boost production by thirty percent.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 05.22.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-05.22.22/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 May 2022 19:39:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-05.22.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, a welcome sight for parents panicked by a critical nationwide shortage of baby formula. First shipment arrived in US from Europe, part of what’s called operation Fly Formula. It’s a B administration initiative that aims to quickly increase the supplies of the vital food source. One hundred and thirty-two pallets of specialty formula were unloaded from US Air Force cargo jets today in Indianapolis. It’s enough for more than half a million baby bottles. It will be inspected and fast-tracked the delivery to desperate families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The President tweeted just a little while ago that a second shipment of formula is on its way to Pennsylvania in the next couple days and then will be distributed throughout the country. But the White House is facing criticism that it didn’t act fast enough. Relief landed in Indianapolis today, pallets of specialized allergy friendly formula airlifted from Germany on military transports. Secretary of Agriculture T.V met the shipment on the tarmac. The formula should arrive in clinics and hospitals across the country in the next few days. But many frustrated parents like twenty-five-year-old A.A, whose four-month-old has a milk allergy, want better, more long-term solutions. The shortage started in February after Abbott Labs, the largest formula manufacturer in the US closes its plant due to safety recall. But the B administration is also bearing some of the blame. With the November midterm approaching, a CBSN poll finds sixty three percent of Americans described the state of the country as uneasy or worrying. And two thirds believe President B is slow to react to important events.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 05.21.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-05.21.22/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 May 2022 18:37:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-05.21.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;It’s a weekend of weather extremes. More than a hundred million Americans are impacted in much of the lower 48 states. Late today, a suspected tornado rip through Arkansas, no word yet on damages or injuries. In Colorado today, it feels and looks like winter. But across a swath of the country, it’s more like summer. Several cities are roasting and setting new heat records, and it’s not even the Memorial Day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s near ninety degrees here in central park. Add the humidity, feels more like a hundred. Across the country, it’s a weekend of extremes. It’s a scorcher in Washington D.C. and much of the east half of the country. Temperatures, twenty degrees above normal with records melting away. In the west, Colorado is shivering record cold. A snowstorm complicating spring and making travel treacherous. This is I-70, traffic reduced to a crawl. The weather was deadly in Michigan. Today, the death toll rose to two in Gaylord. The town shredded by a rare tornado Friday. And the FDNY says one runner died and over a dozen more hospitalized at today’s Brooklyn half marathon. It’s not yet clear if the heat is to blame but organizers had warned about the high temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, help is on the way to address the nationwide shortage of baby formula. Today, crews at Ramstein Air Base in Germany loaded pallets with more than seventy-one thousand pounds of formula. It’s being called Operation Fly Formula. The first Air Force jet arrives tomorrow in Indianapolis. Today, President B signed a forty-billion-dollar aid package to Ukraine. It happened in Seoul, South Korea where the President is focused on his allies and his rivals in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 05.20.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-05.20.22/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 May 2022 22:31:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-05.20.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, you may have noticed that filling your car or truck is especially painful right now. Well, you’re not alone, gas prices are at all time high. The national average for regular gas stands at $4.59 per gallon. That’s $1.50 more than just one year ago. And while gas prices are up, stocks are down. The week ended in the red after flirting with a bare market. Despite stocks making a late-day rally, all three indexes closed down on the week. The tech-heavy NASDAQ posted its seventh straight week of losses and is now down more than twenty-eight percent on the year. There is one bright spot, a Bloomberg report sees the US GDP outpacing China for the first time since 1976. But worries about surging inflation and rising interest rates are hitting Americans’ pocketbooks and retirement savings as fears of a recession loom over the nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plenty of Americans are seeing red tonight, and feeling the financial pressure of an economy potentially heading toward recession. From coast to coast, customers and businesses are trying to make ends meet. But they are telling CBSN that is becoming more difficult every day. There are danger signs everywhere tonight for the American consumers. The cost of gas continues to rise. Food prices are spiking. And corporate profits are taking major hits. Sending markets plummeting this week. The DOW down for seven straight weeks, worse Wall Street performance in more than two decades. The war in Ukraine and Covid related factory closures in China are fueling the worst inflation in forty years. Gas prices have hit records for eleven consecutive days. But it’s the price of diesel, up seventy-five percent over last year that’s impacting M.R’s moving company in Ohio. Her drivers have to change their approaches to cut cost. Despite high gas prices, many Americans say they will hit the road this summer. But seventy percent say record high fuel prices have some affect on their travel plans. J.P Morgan estimates if current trend continues, we could see nationwide average above $6 per gallon by August.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 05.18.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-05.18.22/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 May 2022 21:08:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-05.18.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We want to begin tonight with some breaking news. The President just announcing new actions to try and ease the pain of baby formula shortage. There are two major measures, first to help with supply chain issues. President B is invoking the Defense Production Act to get ingredients to manufactures. That means suppliers will be required to give resources to infant formula plants before other customers. And in hopes of speeding up the import of formula from other countries, President B is directing his administration to use government planes to go overseas and bring formula home. Meanwhile, House lawmakers vote on a bill tonight that makes it easier for low-income families to get formula. Americans who take part in a nutrition program called WIC usually have to get a specific brand of formula. Well, this bill would allow them to get a different brand that’s in stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The President’s late day announcement is the administration’s latest move to try and ease the baby formula shortage. More than half of states have forty percent of formula now out of stock. It’s a full court press to ease the stress of frustrated parents. This Indiana baby formula facility is operating twenty-four seven, trying to boost its output by thirty percent. But for many desperate families, the relief cannot come fast enough. The Federal Nutritional Service that helps low-income women, infants and children known as WIC says more than half of the formula in the US is bought by WIC families, feeding one point four million babies. The largest maker Abbot controls about forty percent of infant formula here in the US. The FDA reached an agreement to reopen its largest plant in Michigan. But that still leaves a gap on store shelves for at least the next two months. And now bad actors are starting to prey on parents.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 05.17.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-05.17.22/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 May 2022 19:19:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-05.17.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We’re going to begin tonight with disturbing new details in the investigation of that Buffalo Supermarket massacre. CBSN has learned that the suspect was considering other targets including elementary schools, churches and Hasidic Jewish communities in New Jersey. The suspected shooter remained behind bars tonight. President B traveled to Buffalo today to meet with grieving families offering them support. The President and First Lady placed flowers at a growing memorial near the Tops supermarket. And in a speech, President B issued an impassioned plea, calling on Americans reject hate and those who peddled promote the racist conspiracy as replacement theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I stand here right now, there are vigils happening to my left and right outside of the supermarket where that massacre occurred. You know earlier today, President B told about seventy families members of those who lost loved ones that democracy was in danger. He said that hate and fear had been fed too much energy but hate will not prevail. Today, President B called Saturday’s massacre “an act of domestic terrorism”, speaking to a community in pain. He condemned the racism that drove the gunman target black people out of Buffalo supermarket, killing ten and wounding three others. He later hugs the three-year-old after speaking with some of the families to listen and console, bringing comfort to them. And they said the President’s visit doesn’t bring their loved ones back, but it helps. And President even leaned in on his own experience of loss telling the crowd that there will come a day when a memory of their loved one brings about a smile instead of a tear.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 05.16.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-05.16.22/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 May 2022 20:10:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-05.16.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We’re here in Buffalo, New York while we’re learning new details about what happened inside this supermarket behind me. And we have new reporting tonight about what led up to Saturday’s deadly shooting. New tonight, authorities tell CBSN that the suspect made multiple visits to the store ahead of his rampage. He called this grocery store attack site number one and he plans to continue his shooting spree at two other places here in the city of Buffalo. We’re also learning tonight that the suspected gunman taunted federal police online month ago. Well tonight, this is a community in mourning. Ten people were killed, three injured, eleven of them were black. Those who were killed ranged from age thirty-two to eighty-six and included a retired police officer, a substitute teacher and a grandmother of six. Tomorrow, President B will come to Buffalo to grieve with this community. And it was a deadly weekend here in America. The United States has seen two hundred and two mass shooting so far this year. Four of them happened on Sunday. We spoke with Buffalo’s police commissioner, J.G, who’s been with the Department for twenty-five years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tops cashier K.A she was at work when the shooter opened fire. She ran to a back conference room with co-workers. They barricaded the door with table. On Saturday afternoon, police say eighteen-year-old P.G dressed in military style camouflage and armed with a semi-automatic rifle shot four people in the parking lot. He then walked inside the supermarket, when he encountered security guard A.S, a fifty-five-year retired police lieutenant. Today, President B paid tribute to him. The gunman shot a total of thirteen people, killing ten. Investigators say he had plans to go another store after the rampage but he was arrested. Police also say he drove more than two hundred miles from his home in Conklin, New York to kill as many black people as he could. G pleaded not guilty at his arraignment on Saturday to a charge of first-degree murder. A CBSN source says the shooter wrote a lengthy online post where he described himself as white supremacist. He even scouted out the supermarket in early March, and visited the day before the shooting.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 05.15.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-05.15.22/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 May 2022 18:29:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-05.15.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;In this place, known as the city of good neighbors, an outsider suspected of conducting the nation’s latest mass shooting and it’s deadliest one this year.

Also tonight, multiple people were wounded in a gunman opened fire inside a church in Laguna Woods, California. But back in here in Buffalo, a traumatize community is clearly grieving. At a Buffalo church service this morning. Tears, sorrow and prayers with the ten souls lost because of hate. Less than twenty-four hours earlier, this grocery store, in a predominately black neighborhood, became a scene of horror of the city worst massacre. Eighteen-year-old P.G was heavily armored, wearing a tactical helmet and gear when he took out an assault rifle and began live streaming the wild shooting spree. Investigators say the gunman traveled from his hometown in Conklin, New York, and drove more than two hundred miles to carry out his attack that was months in the making. Cornered by police, authorities convinced him to drop the gun he had pointed to his neck. He was arrested within minutes of the rampage and charged with first degree murder. Investigators are calling it hate crime and a case racially motivated violence extremism. He pleaded not guilty. They found three weapons including a rifle, a shogun in suspect’s car and an AR-15 in his possession. The N word written on the barrel of his gun, eleven of the thirteen people who were shot were black. An apparent hate-filled manifesto written by G is being evaluated for possible motives.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 05.14.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-05.14.22/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 May 2022 18:19:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-05.14.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;There is breaking news in Buffalo, New York.

&lt;p&gt;Authority called this “pure evil of racially motivated hate crime”. The accused shooter is now in custody and tonight, he faced a judge. Tonight, the eighteen-year-old accused of shooting more than a dozen of people, identified as P.G was arraigned on charges of first degree murder. Authorities say he drove hundreds of miles to the Tops Friendly Markets, three miles of downtown Buffalo, heavily armed and in body armorer.

The US is working now with manufactures to import formula and relieve this nationwide crisis. From coast to coast, over forty three percent of all baby formula products are just out of stock. And in some parts of the country, the problem is even worse. But for some desperate families, especially those relying on government assistance, help may not come soon enough. The FDA will unveil its plans next week. Meanwhile, lawmakers on Capitol Hill have launched investigations and have hearings set to begin next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Department of Health and Human Services launched a website today to help frustrated families find formula, hoping to ease crippling shortage. Fed up, angry and heartbroken, parents from coast to coast are scrambling to find formulas to feed their hungry and helpless babies. On Capitol Hill, lawmakers are launching investigation as to how this frightful formula shortage even happened. The House oversight committee wants to know how the nation’s top producers are going to get formulas back on store shelves. The shortage began &lt;strong&gt;festering&lt;/strong&gt; several months ago, fueled by ongoing supply chain problems. It exploded into a nationwide crisis when Abbott nutrition called three types of infant formula in February after four babies developed bacterial infections. Two died, the company shut down its largest plant in Michigan. Today, President B responded to the critics who say that his administration could’ve act sooner. The White House say it is considering invoking the Defense Production Act to help control the emergency long term. Breastfeeding moms are helping fill the shortage. Many are donating extra milk to bank like this one in New York. While families are turning different method to feed their babies, next week, the FDA is expected to announce plans, detailing how international companies can import their formulas here to the US.&lt;/p&gt;

A struggle for parents to get baby formula. We learned today that the White House is now scrambling to find a solution to the country’s worsening shortage. President B spoke earlier with retailers and manufactures and is trying to import more supplies from other countries. Nationwide, parents are doing whatever is takes to feed their babies. Message board, social media, even offering swap formulas. We’re hearing stories from moms in Texas today, who usually get formula for free from social services say they’ve been out of stock for months. In eight states and here in D.C. more than fifty percent of all formula products were out of stocks. And in additional twenty-eight states have stocks shortages of more than forty percent. Doctors and healthcare workers are urging parents to contact food banks or physician’s offices. And the big warning tonight, do not water down formula to stretch supplies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For nineteen-year-old J.O from Houston, getting baby formula require a three-hour drive to Austin. O paid a hundred and twenty dollars for three cans of her six-month-old daughter. She is among the seventy-five percent of American parents who rely on some formula for their babies. The shortage intensified earlier this year when Abbot nutrition recalled three of its top selling formulas after four babies became ill with bacterial infections. That prompted the shutdown of its largest plant in Michigan. With empty shelves, parents are looking online only to find eye-popping price-gouging in some cases. These twenty-seven ounces can of specialty formula usually costs around forty dollars, it’s now going a hundred and twenty-nine dollars. The search is so widespread that social media groups have been created to connect people with extra formula with those in need. Pediatricians like Northwestern University Dr. J in Chicago are warning parents not to water down formula or follow recipes to make homemade formulas which are dangerous. Abbott, which is based here in Chicago says its plant could start back up within two weeks, but then it’ll take up two months for new product to land on store shelves. In the meantime, the company is flying an extra formula from its FDA registered plant in Ireland to help with supply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, here in the nation’s capital, an escalation from the Congressional committee investigating what happened on Jan.6th, and all coming just weeks before the first televised public hearing. After most Republicans have refused to cooperate, the committee took extraordinarily rare step of issuing subpoenas to some of their Republican colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 05.11.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-05.11.22/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2022 19:06:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-05.11.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, American families are coping with rising prices on everything from groceries, gas and rent. Consumers prices jumped by 8.3% compared to the same time last year, while inflation eased slightly in April remains a four-decade high. And while wage grow has risen at the fasted pace in twenty years that hasn’t kept pace with inflation. Food and gas prices lead the way with the national average for regular gas hitting a new record today at $4.40 per gallon. President B traveled to the Mid-West today and vowed to help American farmers deal with the global spiking prices, taking new steps he says, will help boost food production and lower costs. On Wall Streets, stocks finished in the red with all three indexes falling all the day. NASDAQ led the way, downed more than three hundred and seventy points or more than three percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the cost of gasoline that brought inflation down last month. Remember when prices eased at the pumped a couple weeks ago? Well, now we’re right back to record highs. And economists say it’s global events that are now driving inflation. In a farm in Illinois, President blamed the war in Ukraine for tightening grain supplies, driving up global food prices. In the grocery stores, prices for meats, poultry, fish and eggs are up more than fourteen percent from a year ago. Citrus fruit almost nineteen percent even though the overall inflation rates slow slightly. War in Ukraine is driving up oil prices. Until we see some movements on those fronts, the rising prices will likely continue. Many economists now believe we’ll be dealing inflation in the next year.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening 05.10.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-05.10.22/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2022 18:49:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-05.10.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, President B is fighting back against criticism that his administration is not doing enough to fight inflation. As Americans struggle with rising prices on everything from groceries to diapers. A few items are taking a bigger bite out of family budget than record high gas prices. The national average of regular gas hit an all-time high today at $4.37 per gallon. And while gas prices are up, stocks have been down. The DOW finished in the red for the fourth straight day ending the session at its lowest point in over a year. All three indexes are down more than double digits on the year with the NASDAQ off more than twenty four percent. With rising prices hurting your wallet and stocks hitting your 401K, inflation is taking center stage six months ahead of the midterms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The President today put much of the blame for inflation on the pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. And as voters are holding the President accountable, he says it’s time for Republicans to help come up with a plan. With gas prices spiking again, President B argued he’s doing everything he can to ease the pain for consumers. His comments came as gas prices hit a new record high, jumping seventeen cents in a week, causing sticker shock nationwide. The President pointed to what he has already done to bring down gas prices, releasing millions of barrels of oil from strategic petroleum reserve and allowing the sale of cheaper, higher emission gas this summer. With soaring prices threatening Democrats chances this fall, Mr. B is drawing sharper contrast with Republicans and tying them closer to former President D.T. Tonight, one option the President says he is considering the lower prices, ending tariffs on imported Chinese goods that were put in place by former President T. This is another monthly inflation report, tomorrow could show a big rise in prices.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 05.09.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-05.09.22/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 May 2022 19:04:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-05.09.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We’re going to come on the air with some breaking news about that Alabama couple on the run, a murder suspect and a former jail official accused of helping him escaped have been captured in Indiana following a car chase. Today is Victory Day, a celebration of the defeat of Nazis in WWII. It was expected today that President V.P would declare victory in his latest war. But instead, he used the occasion to blame the West. Meanwhile, Ukraine’s officials confirmed that at least sixty civilians were killed over the weekend when Russian troops bombed the school, it was being used as a shelter in Eastern Ukraine. And an update, First Lady J.B is now back at the White House from a four-day trip to Eastern Europe following a surprise Mother’s Day visit to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President P’s much anticipated speech lasted eleven minutes and ended up having less to do with what he said than what he didn’t say. And that has come as a relief at least for now. The annual Victory Day parade marking the defeat of Nazi Germany had all the &lt;strong&gt;pomp&lt;/strong&gt;, but none of the punch. Instead, the Russian President went on the defensive, accusing the US, NATO, and Kiev of starting the fight and rallying troops to defend the motherland. Victory Day was commemorated in Ukraine too. And in his own speech, Ukrainian President Z accused P of repeating the horrific crimes of Hitler’s regime today. Yet, his soldiers and citizens are facing an increasingly brutal Russian assault in Ukraine. The latest atrocities Russian airstrike that leveled school in Luhansk, where families had taken shelter that now around sixty people are believed have died. Everywhere along the frontline we witnessed the widespread destructions of homes, even whole apartment blocks. And while the last civilian has been evacuated from the steel plant in Mariupol. Roughly two thousand Ukrainian fighters say they will fight the Russians to the end. There is little wonder P couldn’t declare any victory in Ukraine, even in Mariupol, there is no victory to celebrate.&lt;/p&gt;

Dr. B crossed from Slovakia into Ukraine. The First Lady traveled under the cloak of secrecy, becoming the latest high-profile American to enter the country. Dr. B met with A.Z, that country’s First Lady as Russia presses ahead with its punishing, ten-week-old invasion. At the White House President B met virtually with President Z and other G7 leaders. They announced another oil sanctions. These as V.P get to set the celebrate Russia’s annual Victory Day. These troops and tanks seen at the Red Square rehearsal this weekend. It all follows new Russian attacks on civilians in Eastern Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everywhere we’ve gone here in Eastern Ukraine, we witnessed the whole cell destructions of civilian’s areas and Kramatorsk is no exception and, in the Luhansk, it’s now amounting of another atrocity in this war. The direct hit level the building to burning and smoldering ruins, burying those who sought shelter in the desperate believe that hunkering down in the basement of a school would provide some sort of sanctuary from the relentless bombing. The governor says ninety people were inside and, in his words, “All sixty remain under the rubble are now dead”. With Ukraine’s troops resisting the ground defense, the Russian military is gone to the air, with long range artillery and airstrikes with devastating effects. But Russian rocket attack on homes here in Kramatorsk, scattered among the debris, a woman’s shoe, children’s toys, a leather jacket hanging from the tree. Heartbreaking evidence of lives blown apart with the moment of impact. And look at the size of this crater left behind, the force of the blast was so powerful, it tore through this entire residential neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 05.07.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-05.07.22/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 May 2022 18:55:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-05.07.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Today, both Ukraine and Russia say all women, children and the elderly who were seeking shelter at a steel plant in Mariupol who been evacuated. It’s been under siege for weeks. Today, in the west, the city of Odessa came under new Russian fire, hit by at least six missiles and Ukraine says this video shows its drones firing on the flagship of Russia’s fleet in the Black Sea in April. The ship later sank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ukraine is bracing for an increased attacks between now and Monday, which is when Russia celebrates its Victory of Nazi Germany in 1945. The officials have warned residents to heed aired sirens, saying this day is like a red flag to a bull for Russia. In the sky above Moscow, fighter jets were heard fly in a ‘Z’ formation, touting victory in Ukraine. But in the country they invaded, it’s ridiculed. The bodies of Russian soldiers killed on the battlefield in Kharkiv, arranged in a mocking ‘Z’. V.P’s war is not going to plan. In Mariupol, astoundingly the city defenders still barricaded in the steel mill, refusing to surrender. Women, children and the elderly have all now been evacuated from the plant. Not only does P have little show for more than two months of fighting, he stands accused of war crimes, to date, nearly ten thousand. Street by street, A.C and his team use drones to film shattered homes, 3D animations are created to identify structural damage, proof of Russian troops targeting residential neighborhoods. We don’t know how many Ukrainian soldiers are hold up in that steel plant, some are injured but they have held on firm. And now Ukraine’s President V.Z has said he is working on a diplomatic solution to get them all out. But with Monday’s Victory Day fast approaching, the Russian military may push harder to secure victory for their President V.P.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 05.06.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-05.06.22/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 May 2022 17:13:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-05.06.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;First, we have some breaking news, President B just announced new one hundred- and fifty-million-dollar security package to Ukraine. At the Pentagon today, spokesperson J.K confirmed the US is providing intelligence to the Ukrainians to help them defend themselves, including sinking a Russian warship. K said the kind of intelligence provided is legitimate, lawful and limited. In Mariupol, Ukrainian forces are making a last stand against Russian onslaught and that besieged steel plant. Ukraine says Russia is stepping up its attacks in a desperate bid to score victory ahead of Moscow’s Victory Day celebrations on May 9th. The Italian government today ordered to seizure of a luxury super yacht, the seven hundred-million-dollar ship has been linked to V.P and was reportedly getting ready to set sail. Meanwhile, First Lady, J.B is on a four-day visit to Eastern Europe, thanking US troops deployed to the region to deter Russian aggression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heavy fighting continues Azovstal steel plant making the evacuation of civilians slow and perilous. Around fifty made it out safely today, but there are still many more inside. With them, Ukrainian soldiers who remain defiant. Ukrainian soldiers hold out for over two months inside the plant might be delaying the inevitable, but they are the only defense against Russia gaining full control of Mariupol. Nobody expected them to hold out for so long. This is what the city looked like just after the starter of the war and look at it now. Trapped alongside the fighters, over one hundred civilians. The Kremlin has promised another cease fire today to allow a safe passage but it&amp;rsquo;s unclear how successful it’s be. Fighting along several fronts has intensified ahead of Russia’s version of B Day. That’s President V.P is reportedly hoping to celebrate a major victory in this war. Instead, he’s facing accusations of war crimes, to date over nine thousand and Ukraine is wasting no time building its case. Gathering evidence of executions, torture, and rape as well as prove of residential areas were deliberately targeted. In a show of unity, both Presidents B and Z will attend a virtual meeting of G7 leaders Sunday, their focus, building on the already unprecedented sanctions against their Russian counterpart.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 05.05.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-05.05.22/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 May 2022 18:53:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-05.05.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;As we come on the air, protesters spreading across the nation following the leaked draft decision from the Supreme Court that would end federal protection of abortion rights. While the demonstrations have been mostly peaceful so far, there is growing concern about potential violence leading up to the official ruling. Fences have gone up around Supreme Court as crowds are expected to grow in the days and weeks ahead. And CBSN has learned that Justices themselves have been given extra security while several Justices have cancelled upcoming public appearances. CBSN set down with former Secretary of State H.C who called the opinion incredibly dangerous and warned that more could be at risk than just the abortion rights. That draft majority opinion on the future of abortion rights continues to &lt;strong&gt;reverberate&lt;/strong&gt; nationwide. And now there are growing concerns about the potential political violence against the Supreme Court Justices themselves. The Supreme Court under lock down, eight-foot-high fencing now surrounds the building. All entry points have blocked vehicles, and more officers on patrol. The scene reminiscent of what Washington looked like after the January 6th attacks. The nine Justices are also under heavier security. CBSN has learned general threats of violence against them are up. Their home locations have been shared online and receiving more targeted personal phone press. Justice S.A, author of the leaked majority draft opinion, cancelled the scheduled appearance in Nashville. The other Justices are also cutting back on public events. Chief Justice J.R addressed the leak today, calling it absolutely &lt;strong&gt;appalling&lt;/strong&gt; and called the leaker foolish. But the fallout has only intensified. In Illinois, surrounding by five states set to restrict abortion services, clinics trying to prepare for a flood of new patients. Many of those out of state patients would be seen virtually and sent to abortion pills but those are also in jeopardy. At least seventeen states are introduced legislation to ban or restrict access to the pills. Meanwhile, here at the White House, plans for a new press secretary, J.P who is going to step down next Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

The Federal Reserve raise interest rate by half a percentage point. It’s the largest increase of rates since 2000. That was back when the US was in the middle of the dot-com boom. It’s just a second-rate increase since 2018. The goal? Cool inflation but not the job market. Wall Street like the news apparently, stocks roared to their biggest advances in two years with all three indexes posting triple digit gains. President B tried to get ahead of this announcement and persistently negative public assessment to his economic records by touting low unemployment and falling federal deficit. Today’s decision means it’ll soon cost you more to borrow money on everything, from credit cards to homes and cars. An aggressive move by the Fed as consumers battle the highest inflation in forty years and this maybe the beginning. The Fed is trying to tame skyrocketing inflation by discouraging spending, following historically low rates. And the Fed is expected to raise several more times this year which means the price for new loans will also keep going up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now to the fallout following unprecedented leak of a draft Supreme Court opinion overturning the 1973 landmark Roe V. Wade decision that legalized the abortion nationwide. Demonstration for and against were held across the country as some Democratic governors hurried to shore up abortion rights. At the Supreme Court and across the country, today, Americans took the streets to protest the potential end of Roe V. Wade. Asked about the leaked draft opinion, President B took a swipe at former President T and his GOP &lt;strong&gt;coalition&lt;/strong&gt; who helped install the Court’s conservative majority. Democrats now see the possible end of abortion right as another way to call out differences with Republicans ahead of the midterm elections. On Capital Hill, there’s a push among Democrats like Massachusetts Senator E.W to write federal abortion rights into law. To bypass those possible state of abortion ban, some companies are now offering to pay travel expenses for worker seeking abortion services. One of those companies is Yelp, an official there telling us they think it’s quote “vitally important for companies to safeguard their employees”.&lt;/p&gt;

What this all means? This could mean striking down Roe V. Wade after nearly fifty years a decision that has cost fierce divides and legal battles in the decades since. But the court also stressing tonight that the opinion is not final until it’s officially delivered. And the Chief Justice J.R calling the release of this secret document an &lt;strong&gt;egregious&lt;/strong&gt; breach of trust. It’s unprecedented in our nation’s history. Reaction to the news is intense. You’re looking at pictures of the protests behind me. And what this means depends on where you live. Take a look at this map, thirteen states have what’s called a trigger law that would ban nearly all abortions if Roe is overturned. Thirteen more states are poised to outlaw or restricted the procedure. The unprecedented leak send shockwave to Washington. Protestors clashed outside the Supreme Court. Amid increased security at the court, Chief Justice J.R released a statement calling the leak betrayal, intended to undermine the integrity of our operations, and ordering an investigation into the source. Confirming its authenticity, the court said the opinion does not represent the final decision of any member. Leaked to Politico, the ninety-eight-page opinion to overturn Roe V. Wade is the first draft, dated February 10th in a case challenging Mississippi’s fifteen week ban on abortion. Written by Justice S.A says Roe was egregiously wrong from the start, it’s time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people’s elected representatives who can decide whether or not to restrict it. Four conservatives justices reportedly voted in the majority. It’s not clear whether R would have allowed Mississippi law to stand without overturning Roe. If the draft holds, it would represent a triumph for the anti-abortion movement, which has marched for life every year since the court’s landmark 1973 a decision that abortion was constitutional rights, the states could not ban. The court in 1992 was one vote away from overturning Roe. Over the next thirty years, that goal was Republican campaign promise. With Justice T on record opposing Roe, President G.W.B nominated A. A decade later, after the death of Justice A.S, then majority leader M.M blocked President O from filling the seat, giving the former President T the opportunity to nominate G and later K and B. Like with every Supreme Court confirmation hearing since Roe, all were pressed for their views.&lt;/p&gt;

And tonight, after spending more than two months underground at least one hundred civilians were able to get out from the besieged steel plant in Ukraine’s port town. But there are more still trapped after Red-Cross and United Nations called off evacuation today, because of constant Russian shelling. And it comes to the highest-ranking US official, Speaker of the House N.P made a surprise visit to Kiev. Today, P and a delegation of Democratic lawmakers met with the Polish President in Warsaw after a secret trip to meet the President V.Z in Kiev. And we’re learning more tonight of what the US officials believe is Russia’s plan of P’s war. The Kremlin is planning to annex the two eastern regions of Ukraine after failing to capture the capital and overthrown the government. P’s visit to the region comes as the President B is requesting thirty-three billion dollars in funding for Ukraine. That’s money for defense, economic, humanitarian aid and no city need it more than Mariupol. After two months of hell on Earth, the &lt;strong&gt;ineffable&lt;/strong&gt; relief of escape. In a major breakthrough of the UN and international committee of Red Cross, women, children and elderly among the first leaving the darkness of Mariupol steel mill. In the coastal city of Odessa, a child was killed in a Russian missile strike on a residential building according to emergency officials. Combine with Russian attacks on key infrastructure, the country is now struggling of enough food and fuel with vehicle lining up at the pump for miles. But Ukraine is not without its victory, a drone strike taking out two Russian patrol boats on the Black Sea. Throughout the war, Ukraine has creatively defended its territory, not afraid to blow up its own bridges, roads, anything to slow down the Russians. Just outside Kiev, that meant breaching this dam. At great cost to the nearby town of Demydiv. The water completely destroyed this part of town, destroying possessions, destroying homes but we’re told they were happy to do it because if they didn’t, the Russians were going to destroy for them. They effectively save the village and they save the capital of Kiev just further on that direction.&lt;/p&gt;

P is the highest-ranking American lawmaker to visit Ukraine and President V.Z since Russia’s invasion in more than two months ago. Also today, with the war’s casualties mounting, Ukrainians visit cemeteries across the country observing the Orthodox Christian Day of the Dead. But there were some glimmers of hope for some civilians sheltered at a steel plant in Mariupol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Z tweet the evacuation of civilians at the steelwork plant had begun. He said so far around one hundred people have been evacuated. Together with the UN, they are working on the evacuation and many more in the coming days. The first few residents to escape from beneath the steel plants in Mariupol described the hell they’ve endured for weeks. Evacuees are now heading to safety of Ukrainian held territory. Even though the UN said it had brokered a deal with Russians and Red-Cross, the first of successful evacuation, after some many failed attempts, still came as something of a surprise as did this: House Speaker N.P greeted by President Z in the streets of Kiev along with six other Democrats in show of support and to discuss America’s additional thirty-three-billion-dollar US aid package to Ukraine. But winning seems a long way off. The Russian military releasing this video they say shows their high-precision missile attack on Odessa’s military airfield to the South. a reminder there are few places in the country out of Russia’s reach. This is what’s left of an industrial site bombed by the Russian after they learned Ukrainian forces have been using it as a military base. It’s just an indication of onslaught facing soldiers and civilians along the frontline. Exhausted frontline soldiers return to base after weeks of fighting in the Donbas region, well aware there’s more to come. The first Sunday after Orthodox Eastern here is like a memorial to honor fallen soldiers who past. But with the war raging on and the death toll climbing, the past is all too present.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 04.30.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-04.30.22/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 May 2022 16:43:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-04.30.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, Russia and Ukraine are feeling the strain of their brutal two-months-old war. Once again, the Kremlin latest advance is being slowed by fierce resistance. And for Ukrainians, this is what victory looks like. This is Kharkiv, today back in Ukrainian control after being pounded by Russian strikes. The war and its losses, proving unimaginably costly for all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A glimmer of hope for the Mariupol steel mill, Ukrainian media is reporting that twenty civilians that have been evacuated to safety. But many more remain trapped inside. Meanwhile, Ukraine’s President has warned that the country’s nuclear facilities remain at high risk. It was thirty-six years ago this week, an explosion at Chernobyl blew one-thousand-ton lid right off reactor number 4, killing thirty-one people. Decades later at a memorial honoring the dead, these are the survivors, now not of one catastrophe but of two. They targeted nuclear facilities with tanks and repeatedly launched low altitude missiles directly over nuclear reactors. Take Chernobyl, which Russian forces captured for a month. Local media says those who are rescued from Mariupol steel plant were all injured women and children now many more injured soldiers remain trapped inside, some suffering from &lt;strong&gt;gangrene&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;amputations&lt;/strong&gt; without enough bandages to go around.&lt;/p&gt;

Twenty-two-year-old, W.C, a Marine veteran whose family says join the conflict in March, leaves behind wife and infant son. His widow tells CBSN that he did what not a lot of people would do, sacrifice, leaving home to help other people. Also killed, V.H, a Ukrainian journalist who worked for US founded radio for Europe. She was killed when Russian missiles strike her apartment building during yesterday airstrikes on the capital. And this just in, NATO forces say they scramble jets multiple times over the past four days to track and intercept Russian aircraft getting close to alliance airspace over the Baltic Sea and the Black Sea. And today, President Z announced the discovery of another mass grave on the outskirts of Kiev. Z says more than nine hundred bodies of civilians have been found in mass graves around the capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve learned that W.C is killed on Monday while fighting alongside Ukrainian forces. It’s unclear how and where he died. His family hope his body would be found and return back to the United States. He came to fight here and ended up giving his life leaving behind his seven-month-old son, his widow told CBSN today. News of his death comes as Ukrainian forces face down a surge in fighting across the frontlines in the South and East. This video from Russian-backed separatists is said to show what’s left of the Luhansk village of Popasna. A few miles to the North, we followed a volunteer and headed into the ghost town of Lyman to evacuate the few residents still holding out under the bombardment. On the bus, tearful, frighten families tried to comfort one and another as the reality of abandoning the security of homes seems end. The entire city is virtually deserted and these are among last residents to leave. Explosions have been ringing out while we’re here, now is the time for us to leave too. A twenty minutes sprint out of town takes the evacuees to a safer place where buses are waiting to take them further west. With Russian forces bearing down on their town, it’s impossible to know whether they will ever turn home. Now as much as Ukrainian forces are putting up a fight, they are losing ground in certain areas. But there is a sense of that town, the takeover that town is inevitable. Evacuations are also underway in Kharkiv, outside of Kharkiv which is also come under sustain attack.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 04.28.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-04.28.22/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Apr 2022 18:38:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-04.28.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, a clear sign from the White House that the war in Ukraine will likely drag on for months or even years. President B today asking Congress for additional thirty-three billion dollars to support Ukraine’s defense against the Russian invasion. The proposal includes more than twenty billion dollars in military assistance such as artillery and armored vehicles. The war ramped up today with Russian forces launching a barrage of attacks across the country, including at least five missiles strikes on the capital city of Kiev. Explosions could be heard during President Z’s meeting with the UN Secretary General in the capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This massive funding package stresses the B administration’s belief that there is a long road ahead before this war comes to an end. Today, the President vowed that as long as atrocities and assaults continue, the US will keep providing military help. President B urged lawmakers to move quickly on new aid package for Ukraine. Because money for military support including heavy weapon were needed on the battlefield is almost depleted. The President is asking Congress for thirty-three billion dollars for economic, humanitarian and defense funding. On top of the $13.6 billion already approved last month. Top Republicans today signaled they support the measure. With some Russian officials arguing the risk of nuclear wars is now brewing, President B today called that claim irresponsible. Meanwhile, T.R is back in the US after landing in San Antonio overnight as part of a prisoner swap. R, a Marine veteran, spent nearly one thousand days in a Russian prison and now undergoing a medical evaluation for his declining health. The wife of WNBA star, B.G who has been detained in Russia since February, posted that her heart is overflowing with joy for the R’s family. And P.W, who has been in Russian custody since 2018 for alleged espionage said he was thrilled too.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 04.27.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-04.27.22/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Apr 2022 18:30:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-04.27.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, Marine veteran T.R is on an airplane on his way back to the United States after nearly three-year ordeal in a Russian jail. His family tell us that R will head straight to a Defense Department hospital. The prisoner swap was unexpected especially since tension between the US and Russia is at the highest point since the Cold War. In exchange for Reed, the US government freed a Russian pilot, convicted a drug smuggling charges. President B alluded to his release a difficult decision. But tonight, there are at least two other Americans are in Russian jail. In a statement in celebrating release of R, President B said “We won’t stop until P.W and others join T in the loving arms of family and friends.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;T&amp;rsquo;s parents credit their personal meeting with President B last month, right here in Washington for his release, calling in a quote “tipping point” The White House says this was a deal months in the making and that it was the President himself who broke the good news to R’s family. T’s parents described the dramatic moment of something you see in the movies. Video released by Russian State Media captured their thirty-year-old son arriving at Turkey from Moscow. As he crossed a &lt;strong&gt;tarmac&lt;/strong&gt; board a flight home to America. R walks right pass K.Y, who the US agreed to return in exchange for R. The Russian pilot was serving a twenty-year prison sentence in Connecticut, convicted conspiracy and smuggling cocaine to the US. In a statement President B said “The negotiation that allowed us to bring T home require difficult decisions that I do not take lightly”. R’s family say he was coughing up blood multiple times a day, running a fever and that his lung hurt. The Marine veteran was serving a nine-year prison sentence, accused of assaulting two policy officers after a night of heavy drinking in 2019. At least two well-known Americans remain in Russian custody. WNBA star B.G who was arrested in February and P.W, also a Marine veteran accused of espionage who has been detained since 2018, longer than R. W’s family found out about R’s release on TV, and before today, they have not heard from the B administration in three months. But the White House once again reiterated its commitment to bring both W and G home.&lt;/p&gt;

Today, the White House took steps to make a pill treating Covid available to millions more Americans. Pfizer’s antivirus drug Paxlovid has been shown to reduce hospitalization or death in people with Covid by nearly ninety percent. The drug that was one step to the biggest game changers since the vaccine hasn’t have the true impact due to lack of availability. The free antivirus drug is available in about twenty thousand sites around the country. But now there is hope it could change. Pfizer just asked the FDA to authorize its booster for kids ages five to eleven. That’s important because the CDC says seventy five percent of that age group has had Covid at least once. And here in nation’s capital we learned that Vice President K.H tested positive with Covid 19. The White House says President B is not considered a close contact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Vice President tested positive this morning after starting her day at the west wing. We should know she is vaccinated and boosted. But that comes with the White House already having Covid at the top of their agenda. They roll out of a new plan, to make that powerful anti-Covid drug widely available on pharmacy shelves nationwide. Paxlovid, one of the most effective antivirus tools for treating Covid but only more people could get their hands on it. Until recently it was hard to find, but with production up, the B administration announced today it wants to make Paxlovid available for free and it’s launching the effort to double the supply, getting the pills to twenty thousand more pharmacies over the coming weeks. It reduces the hospitalization and death by eighty nine percent in high-risk adult patients. And it’s already authorized for people twelve and older or considered at high-risk often with underline conditions obesity, hypertension, diabetes and asthma. But it must be taken within five days of symptoms. Often ??? a race to find a pharmacy that actually has stock. Another key tool to ??? return normalcy with antivirus drug R. which the FDA just proved to treat children as young as twenty-eight days old with Covid. At a time when more than half of Americans including three out of four children have now survived case of Covid. Nationwide, Covid cases are up twenty-two percent over the last week and forty-five percent over the last two weeks. Still, Covid deaths down over that same period, falling thirteen percent over the last week and thirty-seven percent from last two weeks. Also tonight, Pfizer has requested that emergency use authorization for its booster shot in children ages five to eleven years old. Based on data they submitted to the FDA, a third dose of vaccine show significant protection against the virus in that five to eleven age group.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 04.25.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-04.25.22/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Apr 2022 17:00:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-04.25.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, the world’s richest man, E.M is set to control one of the most influential social media platforms and both lawmakers and Wall Streets are waiting to see what happened next. The Tesla and SpaceX CEO worth two hundred and sixty-eight billion dollars and now he will take Twitter private. The outspoken billionaire says the platform isn’t living up to its potential as a place for free speech. Some are celebrating the deal; others are concerned a hands-off approach to content will make Twitter a &lt;strong&gt;haven&lt;/strong&gt; for disinformation and hate speech. Musk has used the platform to bully critics and reporters who have written articles about him or his companies. The network has nearly four hundred million users, some are not on Twitter, D.T. A little over a year ago, the former President was banned from the site but even with new ownership, T told Fox news he would not rejoin and instead stick with his own social media platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a rocky &lt;strong&gt;courtship&lt;/strong&gt; with threats and counter-threats. But if this deal ultimately goes through, E.M will have completely control of a huge social media platform already entrenched in a debate over free speech. It took eleven days before Twitter’s board unanimously approved billionaire E.M’s bid for the company. And E.M own Twitter could significantly different with fewer ads, less content oversight and some type of edit button. Owning Twitter will also give him the power to address one of his criticisms of the social media platform &amp;ndash; its limits on free speech, which he addressed in his recent Ted Talk. M’s initial offer was met with resistance, Twitter even voted to even adopt what’s called a poison pill to prevent M from gaining a majority stake. But proof of financing and no better offers led to a deal.&lt;/p&gt;

It would the highest ranking of American officials to visit the country since Russia’s invasion two months ago. New attacks this weekend included this missile fired to Ukraine as fighting rages the East. Today, President B send this plead declaring that Kiev still stands despite V.P’s &lt;strong&gt;unprovoked&lt;/strong&gt; attack. And on this Orthodox Eastern Sunday, President Z urged Ukrainians to praise for those who are defending the land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s Orthodox Eastern in Russia and here in Ukraine, a time when many had hoped for a holiday cease fire. But this weekend has been marred by shelling instead. It’s Eastern in Irpin, the site of a brutal Russian massacre. Today, struggling to look forward. But throughout Ukraine, it’s not bells but bombs ring out on this holy weekend. At least six cruise missiles slammed the Black Sea port city of Odessa. A strike on an apartment building killed eight people including a mother with her three-month-old, city officials say. But it’s a different reality in Russia, where state TV broadcasts live picture of President P at Eastern Orthodox mass, as the survivors of his war of Ukraine celebrate the same holy day without the family member his troops slaughtered. At that press conference deep in the subway station, President Z asked world leaders to come to Ukraine, but if they do, please bring weapons his asking for, and just take quote “tragic selfies”.&lt;/p&gt;

So far there is no comment or confirmation from the State Department or the Pentagon. V.Z spoke at a defiant news conference where he said the visit was not quote “a big secret”. Also today, Russian forces launched deadly missile strikes on Odessa, hitting a residential neighborhood. The Russians also took aim at targets in the besieged city of Mariupol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally tonight Ukraine would be getting ready to celebrate Orthodox Eastern tomorrow, but no one is in the mood to celebrate. Those who aren’t fighting for their lives will be praying for those who are. Instead of a temporary cease fire to evacuate civilians. Ukrainian officials accused Russian troops of trying to storm the steelworks where fighters and families are taking shelter. New videos released by the Azov regiment of Ukraine’s national guard is set to show women and children who been holed up in the bunkers beneath the plant for up to two months. The video was reportedly taken a few days ago and not be independently verified. Around a thousand people were about to be trapped in a maze of tunnels beneath a huge industrial site. New satellite images appear to show fresh grave sites as the mayor says twenty thousand civilians may have died so far. Russia’s reach struck Odessa today, Ukrainian officials say, firing at least six cruise missiles into the Black Sea port city. This attack comes as a Russian commander revealed that Moscow planning to establish a land bridge across Southern Ukraine to Transnistria, a breakaway Republic in Eastern Moldova. Russian forces have been intensified attacks along a three hundred miles front line in Eastern Ukraine. In the city of Kharkiv, we’ve found widespread destruction everywhere. And families who’ve been taking shelter deep underground in subway stations for months.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 04.22.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-04.22.22/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Apr 2022 19:12:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-04.22.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We want to begin with some breaking news as we come on the air. A scary scene here in the nation’s capital as the search is on for a suspect accused of shooting multiple people. The mayor just moments ago calling the situation an active threat. Three people were shot including a juvenile. Thankfully all are in stable condition and expected to survive. At least six different law enforcement agencies are responding and trying to clear the scene. This is near a middle and high school which is put on lockdown and residents are told to shelter in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shooting unfolded just as the school was letting out. At this hour, active manhunt for one or more suspects as police go door to door &lt;strong&gt;canvassing&lt;/strong&gt; the neighborhood. The federal and local law enforcements surged into Northwest Washington about four miles north of the White House after gunshots erupted on a major &lt;strong&gt;thoroughfare&lt;/strong&gt; in the nation’s capital. Witnesses described here hearing dozens of shots pulsing through the neighborhood houses multiple schools, a college campus and embassies. In an unverified video that the police have yet to identify, the shooter may have livestreamed the attack. As the injured rushed from the scene, residents were told to shelter in place as police &lt;strong&gt;cordoned&lt;/strong&gt; off the area.

Thousands of troops and innocent civilians remain trapped inside the steel plant in the city surrounded by Russian forces. Putin ordered his troops to seal off the plant to try starving the Ukrainians. Meanwhile, west of Mariupol new satellite images show more than two hundred mass graves with what Ukrainian official estimates are three to nine thousand bodies. President B announcing new funding for Ukraine today, eight hundred million dollars’ worth of aid and military weapons. That includes seventy-two howitzers, ammunition and so-called ghost drones. Those are newly designed for Ukraine to take out high value targets. The Pentagon says these will effectively create five new Ukrainian artillery battalions. The President paraphrased T.R’s message to Russia saying sometimes we will speak softly and carry a large javelin because we’re sending a lot of those.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his late night address moments ago, President Z said he was grateful to the United States for the new package to support and defense tools for his military and considering the circumstances they can’t get here quickly enough. After pummeling Mariupol for weeks and resistance still holding out. President P ordered forces don’t storm in steel plant but block it off so tightly not even a fly escape. With smoke rising above the complex, about a thousand civilians remain trapped in darken maze of tunnels below it. A young mother says they are running out of food and water and hope. Ukrainian troops are in desperate need of military support pledged by President B today. P’s new ambition, capturing parts of the Eastern Ukraine, across a three hundred miles frontline, including Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second large city. Kharkiv has been the target of constant Russian bombardment since this conflict begin. While we’ve been here, we heard explosion throughout the day. The damage is everywhere. That’s the administration building. The target of one of the first &lt;strong&gt;audacious&lt;/strong&gt; rocket attack in the early days of the war.

Russian soldiers and military hardware are pouring into Eastern Ukraine and are ramping up its ground assault along the three-hundred-mile-long frontline. Despite the ground assault coming from three fronts, Russia has not made any significant advances due to a fierce Ukrainian resistance. A senior US Defense official telling CBSN that the first of eighteen &lt;strong&gt;howitzers&lt;/strong&gt; have arrived in Europe and are en route to Ukraine where it’s badly needed to repel the Russian attack. With global attention running high, Moscow took the provocative move of testing launching of new type of intercontinental ballistic missile which is designed to evade defenses. And some of the strongest criticism yet from a prominent Russian oligarch, O.T today denounced the Moscow’s massacre in Ukraine and call for an end of this crazy war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight, Ukrainian President V.Z is warning of a massive attack in the East that could decide the fate of the nation. But with Russia unveiling a new intercontinental missile, V.P is out to prove his reach stretches far beyond Ukraine. A nuclear capable missile armed with a blunt message. V.P warning Russia’s &lt;strong&gt;adversaries&lt;/strong&gt; now have to think twice. The missile doesn’t appear to be ready for a use, but the timing couldn’t be more conspicuous, aim to strike fear into Western countries like the US first supporting Ukraine against Russia. As its forces lay waste Ukrainian cities and civilians, nowhere more apocalyptic than Mariupol. Among the dead reported to be ninety-one-year-old &lt;strong&gt;holocaust&lt;/strong&gt; survivor who hid from the Nazis in the basement only to die in a basement eighty-one years later. Today, another deadline came and went from Mariupol’s die-hard defenders to lay down their arms and surrender these pro-Russian soldiers. But they refuse to give up, barricaded inside a steel mill with hundreds of soldiers and civilians. This commander begs the world for help on Facebook. Elsewhere in the Donbass region where Ukrainian forces are fighting off heavy attacks as Russia concentrates invasion on Eastern Ukraine. They’re trying to surround us says this Ukrainian soldier to the north of Kharkiv, the killing has been so routine, the livings have become numb. Wherever Russian boots marched, they leave behind bodies and booby traps. Russian soldiers are gone now but what’s so haunting is you don’t know what they’ve left behind. And it’s no wonder so many Ukrainians continues to flee the country. The UN reports more than five million people have left since the start of the invasion, calling it a staggering number and Europe’s worst refugee crisis since WWII.&lt;/p&gt;

CBSN has learned that the US is preparing a major new shipment of artillery and ammunition to Ukraine and rushing to get there in time to use against this new Russian offensive. Russian forces have launched a full-scale attack into the Donbass region with what the Pentagon estimates to be additional thirteen battalion tactical groups. The attack stretched across a three-hundred-mile line from the region’s southern tip to the northern end, near the city of Kharkiv, which remains under intense shelling. Civilians continue to be targeted and humanitarian corridors have now been closed. President B held a video call with allies this morning to discuss the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even after weeks of fighting in this country maybe facing its biggest assault yet. President Z in his late night address said Russian army will go down in history as the most barbaric and inhuman in the world. From the hard-hit city of Kharkiv to the North, to the besieged city of Mariupol to the South where Russian troops stormed a steelworks facility where holdout Ukrainian forces are struggling to make a last stand. Russian missile and artillery bombarded target across a three-hundred-mile front line in a ferocious new phase of the war. Ukrainian officials say forces withstood the worst of the onslaught so far President Z vowing no matter how many Russian troops they send here, we will fight, we will defend ourselves. After failing to capture capital Kiev, Russian has turned its focus and firepower on the country’s industrial heart land in the East, repositioning thousands of troops and heavy weapons to the Donbass region, taking over the front line town and Kreminna and expanding areas already under Russian occupation. Including the siege of Europe’s largest nuclear power plant in Zaporizhzhia after a hard-fought battle and put the facility itself in peril. This river effectively serves as a front line between Russian held territory including the nuclear power plant and Ukrainian held territory. But this war has already hit home here. Today, they held a funeral service for twenty-nine-year D.S. The airborne lieutenant killed three days ago when his vehicle struck a Russian anti-tank mine. His mother told us he wanted to be a soldier since he was four. There will be never a child like him, she said, my shining son, they took my only blood, they took son, may he rest in peace, they took my angel. D.S and his wife had only been married a year and a half; they were planning to start a family.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 04.18.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-04.18.22/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Apr 2022 19:47:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-04.18.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, there is some breaking news, for the first time in nearly two years, masks are not required on airplanes after the travel mask mandate was struck down. That means the TSA will not enforce the rule at airports or other transportation hubs. The news come after a federal judge in Florida today ruled the CDC exceeded its authority and failed to follow proper rule-making. The question now is that will the federal government appeal that decision? Well, the Association of Flight Attendance is weighing in tonight, urging calm from passengers saying it usually takes twenty-four to four eight hours to implement new procedures. The CDC still recommends masks for all travelers. All this come at Covid-19 cases are once again on the rise driven by that BA-2 subvariant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re just getting clarities from administration on that judge’s ruling today, saying that they’re reviewing the judge’s order. But that for now TSA will not enforce the mask mandate on public transportation and adding to all of that confusion as you mentioned there is a new mask mandate here in Philadelphia that took effect today. That means about twenty thousand fans here to see the 76ers play tonight will have to mask up once again. You can now fly or ride the buses and trains mask-free. The move comes just hours after a federal judge in Florida ruled it was unlawful. Today, a US district judge said the court accepts the CDC’s argument that masks will limit Covid-19 transmission but not alone was not sufficient to exceed the agency’s authority. In response to the lawsuit, the CDC says it has the legal authority. It was now up to individual airlines to decide if they will require masks. Delta, United and Alaska airlines are the first to say effective immediately. The passengers do not have to wear masks on their planes. But just to reiterate, the CDC does still recommend wearing a mask on public transportation.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 04.17.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-04.17.22/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Apr 2022 19:47:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-04.17.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;For many Americans, it’s been a weekend marked by a return to traditions, but for some, it’s been dominated by fear and violence with three mass shootings in two states. More on that in just a moment, but we begin with the battle in Ukraine. Tonight, Russian officials are warning that Ukraine’s latest fighters in the Southern port city of Mariupol will be quote “eliminated” after failing to surrender. The city has been bombarded for weeks now, civilian deaths there are estimated to be in the thousands. Ukrainian President V.Z says the situation in Mariupol is quote, in his words, “as severe as possible just inhuman”. Today at the Vatican, Pope Francis used his Eastern address delivered to the faithful at St Peter’s Square to call for peace and even caution the conflict to a nuclear war. But the Kremlin’s forces are pulling back. They are preparing for a new offensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the war maybe shifting East, but Moscow can still attack wherever it wants by air. Russia increases missile strikes here in the capital of Kiev and continues to pound major cities in the front lines. The killing continues in Kharkiv, though not stunningly for this person. Seven people including a seven-month-old died in overnight shelling, authorities say. In the besieged Eastern city of Mariupol, Russia has now claimed victory, if true, we may never know the full scale of horror. But Chernihiv in Northern Ukraine offers a glimpse. It too was encircled by Russian forces, cut off from food, water and electricity for weeks. At the height of the siege, up to fifty people were killed every day, so waiting in bread lines, others as they hid inside of their apartments and even more died because of they couldn’t get access to food or water. Ukrainian forces dramatically outgunned, pushed the Russians back. In one remarkable shooting down this bomber, it crashed into this house, killing one man inside but shockingly no more. Its payload failing to detonate on impact, landing on N’s doorstep instead. The two pilots ejected, one survived. And not just anyone, Ukrainian authorities say, posing with V.P and his ally B.A, the President of Syria, where this ace carried out airstrikes. Soon after his capture, Russia pulled back its forces from Chernihiv, a major setback for Russia, though not without a devastating cost to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 04.16.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-04.16.22/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Apr 2022 20:35:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-04.16.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Today, Russia reminded Ukrainians and their western allies that the whole country remains under threat. Its forces pounded multiple targets across Ukraine, new strikes also shook the cities of Kiev and Lviv, both in the West. In the Northeast, missiles rained down on the city of Kharkiv. Once again, civilians and neighborhoods were hit. And in the Southeast, Russia today claims its forces now control urban area of Mariupol, already the strategic city has largely been reduced to rubbles and ruins. Today, President V.Z praised the courage of Ukrainian and despite of Russian invasion as absurd and suicidal. All of these as Russian forces pivot to a new battlefield in a now eight-week war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Z said in a video message last night that the length of this war and how many Ukrainians killed will be decided in part by how quickly Ukraine’s friends supply with weapons. It’s not just Ukrainian civilians in the firing line, but their children. Russian forces didn’t capture capital Kiev, plagued by military failures and the Ukrainian resistance much tougher than many expected. But in Eastern Ukraine, there still being &lt;strong&gt;pummeled&lt;/strong&gt; from the air and bracing for a fresh assault as Russian forces regroup. In the Southern city of Kryvy Rih, officials say they managed to stop Russian forces seizing control of this strategically important airport at the start of the war. Their plan was low-tech but ingenious, parking trucks and construction vehicles on the runway. On a second day of war, a cargo plane and three fighter jets tried to land, they descended to about two hundred meters, made a few circles. And once they realized they couldn’t land, they left. With Ukrainian forces massively outgunned by Russia, they’ve made up for it with smarts and creativity. But they believe they cannot win the war without more weapons from the west. When the invasion first began, there was a sense of shock here, martial law was implemented. Suddenly there were checkpoints all over the country, people were every jumpy, very anxious and people began to flee the country. More than four million Ukrainians have now fled the country. But for those people who have stayed in areas that are not under Russian occupation, we’ve seen shops reopening, restaurants reopening, and people taking their children to playgrounds. It’s as if they want to live normal life as possible almost as a point of pride.&lt;/p&gt;

A senior US Defense Official confirms that two Ukrainians anti-ship missile strikes, first disabled, then sunk one of Russian most important warships. In response, Russian forces shell several cities in Southern and Eastern Ukraine today. They also hit a facility on the outskirt of Kiev, Ukraine’s capital. ??? Ahead of original police force there since the civilian death toll in the area tops nine hundred and will likely rise nearly all the victims killed by gunshots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight, Moscow is outrage for the US and NATO shipping weapon system to Ukraine, warning there could be unpredictable consequences. The Kremlin is also threatened to increase air attacks here in Kiev, after that stunning Ukrainian missile strike that sunk Russia’s lead warship. It was the flagship of the Russian navy in the Black Sea, but tonight, it’s sitting at the bottom of it along with supersonic missile launchers and the Kremlin’s pride. The Moskva was once the terror of Ukraine’s coast that infinitely??? threatened these Ukrainian soldiers in the first days of the war, only to be rebuffed with ex??? The Pentagon confirmed the ship was struck by Ukrainian made missiles that now have scared the rest of Russia’s fleet away. But Russia is still striking by land and by air, firing three missiles at the capital Kiev. This as Russia continues to hold back its ground forces after failing to capture it, leaving behind blood stained bootprints in its wake. Indeed, P is called alleged war crimes in the Kiev region fake news but nine hundred civilian deaths have already been recorded here. Prosecutor General says there are thousands more throughout the country.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 04.14.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-04.14.22/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Apr 2022 18:25:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-04.14.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, as significant and symbolic blow to Russian military might, Ukraine says an anti-ship missile sank the lead warship in Russia’s Black Sea fleet. The Russian Defense Ministry says the ship sank while being towed to port because of an unexplained fire, it has not confirmed the Ukrainian missile strike. Either way, this marks a loss for Russian President V.P’s military as he tries to refocus and regroup ahead of an expected offensive in Eastern Ukraine. Meanwhile, European leaders are drafting a resolution that will ban all oil imports from Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A senior US Defense official says the flagship of Russia’s Black Sea fleet suffered an explosion when it was sixty miles off the coast of Odessa. Now can’t confirm if Ukraine struck it with its own missiles but it was well within range. A shocking blow to Russia, its powerhouse on the Black Sea now sunk. The pride of the Russian Navy, the warship Moskva, was part of the fleet terrorizing Ukrainian coast. Armed with supersonic missile launchers, it was originally designed in the Cold War to take out US aircraft carriers. Instead, it was taken out by two Ukrainian made Neptune missiles Ukraine says which would mark the first time it’s destroyed a major Russian vessel at sea. Moscow refutes the claim, insisting something sparked munitions on board to explode. But admitting its crew of nearly five hundred sailors had to abandoned the ship. The Pentagon says Russia has pulled its remaining ships from the area. While just up the coast, Mariupol on the brink of doom, many of the city defenders have now been captured. Russian TV footage purports to show them surrendering. But these die-hard Ukrainian forces encircled by the enemy say they will not give up. Ukrainian President V.Z says it’s a cycle of death, but the blood is on Russia’s hands. In Kharkiv, there’s no rest even for the dead. We witnessed the aftermath of Russia’s attacks in the town of Andriivka, where Ukrainian soldiers are now clearing these homes of mines met only to terrorize civilians. Now the hunt for the responsible begins, Ukrainian investigators tell us they already located the very towns where some of these Russian soldiers are from. And they’re determined to bring them to justice even if it takes years, maybe decades.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 04.13.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-04.13.22/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Apr 2022 17:29:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-04.13.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We’re learning tonight that the alleged gunman reportedly called the cops on himself and told them to get him from a McDonald in Manhattan. Now locked up, there is a sigh of relief in the Big Apple after nearly thirty-hour manhunt. We have a new video tonight of Frank James leaving a New York City &lt;strong&gt;precinct&lt;/strong&gt; and being transfer to federal custody. And this just in, he will appear on court for the first time tomorrow. James is accused of shooting ten people, injuring more, five of the victims are students heading to schools, luckily no one was killed. Authority says tonight there is no indications that James ties to any terror organizations. And while the motive remains unclear, there is a trail of profanity-laced rants on social media videos that were allegedly posted by James.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This exhausted manhunt is finally come to an end as James is arrested, just a few miles from the subway station here where the shooting happened yesterday morning. As it turns out, he wanted to be arrested as law enforcement sources tell the Associate Press that he actually called the police to come pick him up. Sixty-two years old Frank James, New York City’s most wanted man in the last day of a half, was arrested this afternoon on a street corner in Manhattan’s east village. James had been wanted since yesterday morning’s subway shooting, led more than twenty people injured including ten from gun shots. Surveillance video shows the alleged gunman entered the subway station early the morning of the attack, wheeling the same black cart that was later recovered from the scene. Official says James is the man who donned the gas mask, detonated smoke bombs and fired thirty-three shots in a packed subway car. After the attack, police say James slipped onto another train car, rode one stop and escaped, sparking a multi-state manhunt. But police did recover some important evidences on the scene, including a nine-millimeter gun, three extended magazines, a hatchet, gasoline and four smoke grenades. They also found bank cards and a key to this U-Haul investigators say James had rented. The search of the van turned up a heater, some clothing and blankets they believe he spent at least one night sleeping in the back. His arrest record spans at least fifteen years in several states includes nine &lt;strong&gt;misdemeanor&lt;/strong&gt; arrests in New York between 1992-1998 for possession of burglary tools and criminal sex act. Police say he purchased the gun used in attack from an Ohio &lt;strong&gt;pawn&lt;/strong&gt; shop in 2011. But the serial number had been scratched out when it was recovered from the scene. Investigator described James a lone wolf, posted hours of racist, violent rants on YouTube, including ones against the mayor. During the investigation which is ongoing, authorities say they searched storage unit in Philadelphia which is registered to James finding among other things like silencer, ammunition, AR-15 and 9mm weapons. James is facing several charges including terrorism against the mass transit system and if convicted, he could face up to life in prison.&lt;/p&gt;

The suspect is still on the loose, police just released the name of a person of interest. Police are looking for Frank James. The NYPDC is offering a fifty-thousand-dollar reward. He is described as a heavyset dark skin male. Police located a U-Haul related to the incident. But there are still a lot of questions tonight, more than twelve hours that the shooter deployed a smoke &lt;strong&gt;canister&lt;/strong&gt; and opened fire on an end train about to enter the Brooklyn station. The New York Police Chief tonight says that it could have been much worse. At least twenty-nine people were injured, ten people who were shot and five are listed in critical stable condition. Police say other victims suffered smoke inhalation and &lt;strong&gt;shrapnel&lt;/strong&gt; wounds. Cell phone video show chaos and confusion as horrified victims ran from smoke-filled subway car. Heroic New Yorkers were seen providing first aid. And President B tonight praised the first responders and the civilians who didn’t hesitate to help their fellow passengers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York City remains on edge tonight as a suspect is still on the loose who is considered armed and dangerous. Now a person of interest has been named in this attack, it’s unclear what his connection might be to the attack. Also unclear tonight, the motive on this horrifying shooting. Just before 8:30, rush out riders on a packed Manhattan-bound train were terrorized, after a lone gun man first set off the smoke bomb, then opened fire at random. Police are searching for sixty-two-year-old Frank James, a person of interest, whose addresses in Wisconsin and Philadelphia, he is described as heavyset wearing an orange and a gray hoodie. A U-Haul key was found at the scene that led police to this van, rented by James in Philadelphia. The van was recovered about forty miles from the shooting scene. Cell phone video shows horrifying riders, bolting from the train after it pulled into the station. Passengers drag the victims to the safety while others &lt;strong&gt;limped&lt;/strong&gt; off on their own, confusion reigned. First responders soon flooded the South Brooklyn neighborhood, treating victims from smoke inhalation and gunshot and shrapnel wounds. Police and FBI investigators scoured the station looking for a suspect in a green worker’s vest. They recovered a &lt;strong&gt;tote&lt;/strong&gt; bag with a &lt;strong&gt;hatchet&lt;/strong&gt;, two gas canisters and a semiautomatic handgun that apparently jammed during the melee. They also found several undetonated devices and spent ammunition magazines. Police are checking surveillance videos and say cameras were not working at three nearby stations. Today, President B addressed the shooting. While investigator might lack some of the critical evidences of the surveillance videos were not working at the subway stations, they will rely on the surveillance video out on these New York City streets that are seemingly everywhere as well as the surveillance videos from some of the businesses that line these streets, hoping to catch the glimpse of the suspect as he fled the subway station.&lt;/p&gt;

The Pentagon is saying an earlier indication that Russian troops are trying to resupply after pulling out of the North. New video shows a convoy of reinforcements heading towards the Donbass region from inside Russia. And as a reminder that women and children bear the brunt of war, we learned today from UNICEF that nearly two thirds of Ukraine’s kids have been displaced and the situation is only getting worse. In the besieged city of Mariupol, residents have gone weeks without running water, electricity, food and medical supplies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several troubling new signs that Russia is marshaling its forces for an all-out assault on Eastern Ukraine, even Austria’s chancellor who managed to sit down with Russian President V.P came away saying he’s pessimistic about what comes next. In Eastern Ukraine, it’s a race against time to dig trenches and evacuate civilians as the Russian war machine pivots. Shelling intensified in the Eastern overnight as new satellite images show that eight-mile convoy of Russian trucks and armored vehicles moving through the East for the Donbass region, home to a large population of Russian backed separatists. The latest evidence of shifting strategy after Russian forces failed to take the capital city of Kiev. Ukrainian President V.Z pleaded with South Korea’s parliament today “give him weapon he can use to defend Russian off Donbass and in Southern Ukraine”. Where the mayor of the port city of Mariupol today estimated that as many as twenty thousand residents have been killed in the ongoing siege. And the horror there isn’t over, Russian military releasing video of missiles being fired from ships on the Black Sea. Right now, the Russians aren’t negotiating, they’re digging in, tapping a new commander to turn the invasion around. He’s a veteran of Russian offensive in Syria where his tendency to target civilian facilities like hospitals, earn him a nickname “the butcher in Syria”. Indian Prime Minister M.M met virtually today with President B, both of them condemning of killing of innocent Ukrainians. And the death toll from that train station attack stands at fifty-seven with the Russian story about it changing. Initially Russia’ Defense Ministry said that it bombed the train station because weapons were being hidden there. But once faced with evidence of clear civilian casualties that the Defense Ministry now says that it had nothing to do with it at all.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 04.10.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-04.10.22/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Apr 2022 20:49:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-04.10.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Russia’s attacks and atrocities are mounting in Ukraine and so is the exodus from the country. The United Nations said today that more than 4.5 Ukrainians have fled the country thirty-seven days after Russia’s invasion. And new satellite images show a massive eight-mile-long Russian convoy headed East. This is after forces retreated from the North to regroup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is too very different country depending on where you are, in the North here in Kiev, relative calm now that areas around the capital are back in Ukrainian hands, while along the Eastern front in Donbass, residents are braced for an all-out Russian assault. From land, sea and air, Russia has unleashed sustained misery on the Donbass region for more than six weeks. There is not much that hasn’t been reduced to rubble in cities like Mariupol. Those who’ve escaped denounce it as worse than hell. And there is new offensive on the way. Satellite image shows a massive eight miles Russian convoy heading South towards the eastern frontline with a new battlefield commander at the &lt;strong&gt;helm&lt;/strong&gt;, A.W. The general accused of ordering strikes that flattened civilian neighborhoods in Syria. Already in liberated areas around Kiev, destruction on an industrial scale and the street littered with graphic evidence of atrocities the kind seldom available to prosecutors. Lawmaker K.R has also been collecting evidence of hidden crimes, the weapon wields behind closed doors, rape. The stories from these occupied towns are nauseating, mothers forced to watch their sons and daughters violated, soldiers raping women in front of their children. Soldiers who also have mothers back home in Russia. The hot line setup to report these war crimes has been overwhelmed. More than fifteen thousand calls a day, says Ukraine Human Rights Chief, M.S.&lt;/p&gt;

J also pledged more military aid to Ukraine. In Moscow, the Kremlin has reportedly put a single commander in charge of an invasion plagued by casualties and poor logistics, fearing a new offensive. Ukrainians today were still trying to flee the Eastern part of the country in the wake of another brutal assault.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russian forces have withdrawn from Ukraine’s capital Kiev, the fighting is ongoing here in Southern Ukraine as well as in the East, and Russians continue to reign terror on this country from the air. This train station in Kramatorsk was packed with thousands of people evacuating their homes in Eastern Ukraine on Friday, when authorities here say it was hit by a Russian missiles strike, killing at least fifty including children. Russian claims it wasn’t involved, a senior US defense official says the US isn’t buying it. We drove north this week, near Ukraine’s border with Belarus with some Russian forces are now thought to be regrouping. On highway, the Russian destroyed bridges when they left, so we took back roads, getting bogged down in the mud and making it out with a helping hand from the Ukrainian military. The Russian soldiers left the village of Termakhvka just a week ago. The streets are still littered with the wreckage of war. Russia has indicated that its focus is moving to the Eastern Ukraine and Ukrainian officials have urged civilians living in the Luhansk region to flee immediately. Meanwhile, following Russian military failure during this invasion, there are reports that a new Russian general, A.D has been put in charge. Now he apparently gained experience in Syria where Russian is been accused committing war crimes by the United Nations.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 04.08.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-04.08.22/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Apr 2022 18:30:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-04.08.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, we want to start with breaking news out of Ukraine while we are learning about the most recent Russian atrocity, a missile attack on a train station. Just tonight, President Z says everyone involved will be held responsible. At least fifty-two people were killed and more than a hundred others injured in the attack on a train station. Graphic video of the scene shows bodies lying among luggage, strollers and stuffed animals. Ukrainian officials believe two missiles were fired from Russian occupying territory Donbass region. Six weeks into the war, Russian forces have shifted their focus to Eastern Ukraine, as more suspected war crime are revealed. In Cherniev, north of the capital, the mayor says nearly seven hundred people were killed. Survivors described the horror during Russian siege, dozens were held captives in a tiny basement for weeks along some dead bodies. It was so cramped that one man described tie himself to a wall to sleep, standing up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About four thousand people were gathered at that rail station at the time of the attack to get on trains to escape from the violence. Ukraine’s officials have repeatedly advised residents to leave Donbass as the war escalates. The strike that come towards the railway station was not only deadly it was personal. The Russian missiles describe with the words “For the children”. It’s an essential hub for civilians fleeing the war at Donbass region among those killed, women, the elderly and the very young. Another entry on the growing list of Russian atrocities, deliberated Bucha, streets were littered with graphic evidence of war crimes. But lawmaker K.R wants the world to know about the hidden crimes, a weapon wields in secret, rape. R is collecting evidence to the take to the international court. In Bucha, at least five women came forward to share their stories with her, including a mother of twenties, with a six years old son. On communications intercepted by Ukrainian intelligence, you can hear a Russian soldier phoning back home revealing those raped are often very young. I’m shocked at what’s going on here, he said, a woman and a sixteen-year-old girl raped by guys in the neighboring village. The Ukrainian investigators are collecting evidence of crimes almost as they happened. And prosecutors say they are building a detailed case against Russia.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 04.07.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-04.07.22/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Apr 2022 18:12:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-04.07.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We’re going to begin here on nation’s capital, because today we had a front row seat to something that has never happened on our nation’s history, something will no doubt changing lives for decades to come. Today, the US Senate voted to confirm Judge K.B.J for a life-time appointment to the nation’s highest court. For its two hundred- and thirty-three-year history, the Supreme Court has weighed the most important issues in America that affect our everyday lives. But the court has not represented the diversity of the American people. President B promised to change that. And six weeks ago, he nominated Judge J in the most consequential decision a President can make. Three Republican Senators of Utah, Maine and Alaska broke with their party to vote for J.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judge J’s confirmation was &lt;strong&gt;contentious&lt;/strong&gt; but never really in doubt and now in today’s vote, she will take her place in history. With Vice President K.H &lt;strong&gt;presiding&lt;/strong&gt; Judge K.B.J made history. The fifty one year old who wrote in her high school year book she hope to be a judge will be the Supreme Court first black woman Justice, a filling a campaign promise by President B, he watched the vote in the White House with J with Senate Democrats celebrated. The vote was bipartisan, barely, as Republicans left the chamber, one of them Senator M.R stood alone. He and two other moderate Republicans saying J is qualified and the confirmation process is broken joining all fifty members of the democratic caucus in voting yes. J’s qualifications were out of Supreme Court central casting, top Ivy League in legal credentials, nearly a decade experience as a Federal Judge. The confirmation hearings often were heated. The Republicans say she is soft on crime and extremist. With replacing Judge S.B, J won’t change the balance of currently conservative court. But as the first black woman, her perspective and experience could have influence and her voice is already been heard. For now, she is still Judge J, she won’t become Justice until Justice B stepped down at the end of term, which probably would be in late June or early July and at that point she will be officially be sworn in and get to work.&lt;/p&gt;

For the first time, V.P’s two adult daughters were sanctioned, it’s believed the Russian dictator, another Kremlin leaders, hide their wealth through family members. These latest sanctions come amid Russia’s escalating brutality in Ukraine, including alleged war crime in port city of Mariupol. The mayor there detailing what could be the highest death toll in a single town of this war, more than five thousand civilians killed he said, and he also accused Russian troops of using mobile crematoriums to burn bodies to cover tracks. And there’s yet more evidence of Russian atrocities that are coming to light including this attack on an ambulance outside of Ukrainian children’s hospital Mykolaiv.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President B says the US and its allies are not only &lt;strong&gt;stifling&lt;/strong&gt; Russia’s economic growth today, but for years to come. Tonight, though Ukraine’s Z saying those sanctions are simply not enough to stop the bloodshed that is happening right now. President B promised to make Moscow pay its brutality today, rolling out another round of harsh economic penalty. The US banned all new investment in Russia by Americans, blocked assets from two of Russia’s largest banks from the American financial system and targeted Kremlin officials and their relatives. The US also sanctioned V.P’s adult daughters, both billionaires living in Russia and rarely seen in public. The US also leveled its criminal charges against Russian oligarchs today, P.M accused of invading sanctions, millions of his assets seized. But the sanctions so far have not targeted Russia’s energy sector, the country’s biggest money maker and the Ruble is now back to its pre-invasion worth. Ukraine’s President V.Z dismissed the tough rhetoric around sanctions today, and criticized those world leaders who still think that war and war crimes are not something as horrific as financial losses. Meanwhile, Treachery Secretary J.Y said the war and the sanctions causing economic pain around the world. Secretary Y also said today that President B wants Russia to be expelled from the G20, the group that is made up of the world’s twenty largest economies adding the US will boycott meetings at its next summit if Russia officials show up.&lt;/p&gt;

We want to begin on the world stage and the clear message that leaders cannot and should not turn their eyes away from the &lt;strong&gt;gruesome&lt;/strong&gt; atrocities happening in Ukraine. Today, President Z made an impassion plead to the United Nations to do more to stop Russian war crimes. Z put the members of the UN Security council unnoticed, saying they believe the time of international law is gone, they must act immediately. World leaders were left stunned, silent as he shows stomach-turning footage of dead civilians and alleged women raped in front of their families. Tonight, the Secretary of State called what happened outside the city of Kiev, a deliberate campaign to killed. And in a chilling new charge, American UN Ambassador alleged tens of thousands of Ukrainians were captured and sent to filtration camps, reminiscence of Nazi dead camps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As those grave images poured out Ukraine, President is warning that this is only the beginning and the new evidence will soon surface that the Russian is committing more war crimes. He also had harsh words for the United Nations, criticizing for failing to stop the violence. Before the audience of the world’s top diplomats, Ukrainian President V.Z called out the United Nations for having what he described as a broken system that has no power to stop the war. Z ??? the Russian soldiers accused carrying out war crimes in Bucha to ISIS terrorists, hoping to shock the group into action. Z shown a gruesome video of the latest atrocities which were then stunningly disputed by Moscow’s ambassador to the UN who called them a crude &lt;strong&gt;forgery&lt;/strong&gt;. With documented evidences of civilians killed in Bucha, the B administration is backing investigation by the International Criminal Court or ICC. But neither Russian nor the US is party to the ICC made up of one hundred and twenty three nations which is responsible for holding war crime trials if Putin was ever charged he will need to be arrested and handed over to the court which is unlikely. The B administration will continue to squeeze Russia economically, new sanctions expected Wednesday will ban all new investment there and impose additional penalties on government officials and their family members. Following those latest brutal acts, several NATO nations expelled Russian diplomats this week and the European Union has proposed an all-out ban on Russian coal imports.&lt;/p&gt;

The Russians are retreating from the towns around the capital of Kiev, but they’re leaving behind evidence of atrocities. The pictures are horrific, bodies of dead civilians in the streets, some allegedly killed execution style. Ukrainian President Z visited the town of Bucha today, and called what he saw genocide. The &lt;strong&gt;depravity&lt;/strong&gt; has sparked global outrage in President B’s called for a war crime trial against President V.P. And this just in, Z will address the UN Security Council tomorrow, Russia is a permanent member of that group. CBSN has learned nearly seventy percent of the Russian troops that were surrounding Ukraine’s capital have started to reposition, the US Defense official saying that’s likely just to regroup before heading back in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Russia denies killing unarmed civilians saying it’s another provocation from Ukraine. But when we revisited Bucha today, the horror of Russia’s war in residential area was deniable. These are the scenes that Russia denies, the unburied dead sprawled across the town who do not wear military uniform. The are civilians like these, executor with their hands bound behind their backs. Evidence of war crime, says Ukraine, next to this church a hastily dug mass grave one of several in this town. The government says nearly three hundred bodies have been found. And the Ukraine military released this footage of what it calls a basement torture chamber showing a line of people hands tied before receiving a bullet in the head. It doesn’t matter where you go in Bucha you could stumble across a crime scene. Some of the worst fighting in Dunbas has been in the abandoned city of Mariupol with one hundred thousand residents still remain trapped, a humanitarian relief convoy was not able to enter the city for the fourth straight day due to security concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

Tonight, several world leaders are pledging to hold Russia accountable. In a Sunday exclusive interview today with Face the Nation moderator M.B, Ukraine’s President called the ??? acts brutality &lt;strong&gt;genocide&lt;/strong&gt;. This video shows the moment of gun fire exploded earlier this morning killing at least six people injuring at least a dozen others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Police here says suspect or suspects remain at large. They did recover one gun from the crime scene here. Meantime, the mayor says this mass shooting has led this city a broken heart. A crowd fighting in downtown Sacramento early this morning, when the gun fire erupted. The shooting left six people dead among those killed, F.T’s son D. Twelve others were hospitalized, several of them are fighting for their lives, as officials try to determine the motive for this mass shooting. Across California, homicide up thirty percent from 2020, and nationwide it went up seven-thirty percent in the big cities. On CBS Face the Nation, New York City’s mayor E.A says he is trying to stop the float guns into communities. In Sacramento, as police investigate the deadly shooting, the city and victims’ families grieved together. And when you include the dozen wounded today’s violence would be the worst mass shooting in Sacramento history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is now in its sixth week. Today, missiles hit the historical city of Odessa, striking oil refinery and storage depot. The Moscow’s war strategy appears to be shifting, no longer focused on surrounding the capital of Kiev, they’re now intensifying the assault in the East and the South of the countries.&lt;/p&gt;

And tonight, especially around Kiev, those forces appear to be in retreat. Ukrainian reclaiming towns and villages in the capital regions are finding a dystopian landscape, one of death and destruction. Today, Pope Francis rebuked Russia called “savage war” and as fighting rages in some of other parts in Ukraine, so does the suffering of civilians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US says it has evidence that this invasion has been a strategic disaster for Russia and Ukraine says Russian forces are now slowly withdrawing from the north of this country. But there are fears that regrouping to attack elsewhere and where Russian troops have been forced out, they left devastation. V.P’s original battle plan appears to be a failed, his troops have taken heavy losses and Ukrainian soldiers are recapturing towns including Irpin, just north of the capital Kiev. But there is no celebration because the Russians have left homes shattered and chart ??? and hundreds are dead according local officials. Other places are still occupied. This video appears to show Russian forces trying to disperse civilian protesters near city of ???. In ??? Russian airstrikes hit around five hundred yards from S.P’s home last month, destroying his neighborhood. Ukraine’s president V.Z warned last night that is Russian forces withdraw from north Ukraine, they’re massing in the east, and preparing to strike again. His government wants more help from the US and its allies. Some Russians have simply voted with their fate, they’ve left their country either because they’re poured ??? by the invasion or because they’re worried about the impact of sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 04.01.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-04.01.22/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Apr 2022 15:33:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-04.01.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;By one measure the American economy is surging to the level not seen since March, 2020. Today’s job report from the Labor Department show employers are added another four hundred thirty-one thousand jobs in March, and the unemployment rate fell to a pandemic low of 3.6%. The Labor Department also revised its ??? estimate from January and February showing an additional ninety-five thousand jobs. But by other measures, the US economy is stuck in a rut, rising inflation, supply chain bottleneck, the pandemic and war in Ukraine have their own way to contribute to higher prices at gas station and grocery store. For some of the Americans these price increases have negated higher wages. But despite these challenges, the Labor Market has remained resilient, with employer adding more than four hundred thousand jobs for eleven straight months. In fact, some sectors of the economy now employ more people than prior to the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;America is back in business, most Covid restrictions are gone now, businesses are ramping up and they are hiring. Today, President B was quick to take credit. Americans are also back in the move, some of the strongest job gains are in leisure and hospitality. At the same time, employers can’t fill job fast enough, there are nearly two job openings for every unemployed worker and people are still quitting jobs at near record rates, roughly forty-seven million last year. Overall, average wages are up 5.6% over last year. Right now, inflation is the number one concern across the country, a new gallop poll reviews said that Americans are more concern about the inflation now than at any time since 1985.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 03.31.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.31.22/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Apr 2022 18:21:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.31.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, in an extraordinary move to help Americans combat rising gas prices, President B is going to drain roughly one third of the oil reserve, that is the largest ever. It’s actually the fourth time this measure has been taken, it happened during Golf War, after hurricane K and the 2011 Libyan Civil War. President B will tap one million barrels a day, but that’s only a drop in bucket when it comes to the domestic oil consumption. The US currently uses around twenty million barrels a day. And Americans are only seeing sticker shot at the gas station, the Commerce Department saying today that people are also paying sharply higher prices for food and other necessities, inflation is rising at the fastest rate in forty years. The average price of gas in US now stands at $4.23 a gallon, that’s up forty seven percent from just a year ago. And on Wall Street today, stocks tumbled to the close with all three major indexes following more than one and half percent on the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight, President B is offering gas customers like the one you see behind me a war time bridge as he described it to get through the fuel intense demand of the summer until the US production picks up this fall. But with so much of play on the global energy market, there is just no guarantee while you pay to fill up or come down. Tonight, President B on a unprecedented effort to the financial squeeze to fuel, placing the blame to recent jump ??? Energy crisis ??? in Ukraine. Mr. B announcing several new efforts including accessing a third of nation’s strategic petroleum reserve until October. Now tax rebates they are passed by states like California typically come out of any tax refund you will otherwise receive. And here in Maryland, it’s actually the station owners who get tax holiday with the state expecting those savings to be passed along to customers.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 03.30.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.30.22/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Mar 2022 20:41:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.30.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;As we come on the air, it is dangerous situation for parts of the US as tornado watches have been issued in at least nine states. The National Weather Service has been busy today, issuing dozens of warnings for twisters and hurricane force wind gusts. Tornados have already hit Arkansas where rescue teams were deployed after an EF2 tornado struck. At least seven people were injured in the town of Springdale and Johnson and the damage is significant, more than one hundred thousand are without power tonight from Texas to Tennessee, and that number is expected to grow. The line of storms will move east tonight and the threat continues through Thursday morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These storms are hitting hard right now, we hear that &lt;strong&gt;eerie&lt;/strong&gt; sounds of that tornado warning siren right here in Memphis, and the same thing is happening all across the region. A tornado touching down just outside of Jackson, Mississippi tonight as severe weathers are battering the south. Millions in the path of punishing winds, pounding rain and potentially more tornados. A highly electric line of storms putting on a light show in Kansas, what’s called upward lightning. Wind gusts exceeding one hundred fifteen miles an hour in Arkansas, where seven people were hurt, one critically after a powerful tornado ripped across the region. School damaged in Springdale in the State’s west corner, no one was inside at that time. Several homes and businesses flattened and debris in every direction. In Missouri, a tornado tearing the roof off the D’s home in St. Joseph as the family took cover in the basement. Power lines toppled and trees uprooted from wind gusts topping ninety miles an hour. Across six states, more than a hundred thousand families are without power. A number of States are facing a possibility of tornado both tonight and overnight. Those overnight hours are so dangerous because people tend to be asleep and sometimes miss the warnings.&lt;/p&gt;

But there was a positive development today as negotiators from Russia and Ukraine met in Turkey for a day of peace talks aimed at ending Russia’s deadly invasion. And in an address tonight, President Z said the talks were positive, but that doesn’t drown out of the sound of Russian attacks. The Russian negotiators raise the possibility of meeting between the President Z and Putin that could occur after a draft agreement was ready. And there’s this new development tonight in the effort to target Russian oligarchs we’re learning tonight that the British seized their first superyacht, a fifty-million-dollar ship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pentagon confirmed there has been some movements by a small number of Russian forces pulling back from Kiev, but it’s calling this a repositioning not retreat. And indiscriminate of shelling of cities to the South and East continues. This maybe the first real sign of progress but it certainly falls short of a cease fire so desperately need. Russian negotiator V said Ukraine’s proposal to remain neutral by not joining any military alliance would be put to President P. But it’s early days and there is skepticism in the US. Boardroom negotiations far away from the battlefield have yet to make any difference for Ukrainians enduring the mounting horrors of this war. The port city of Mariupol has all but collapsed. An apocalyptic scene of rubble, twisted metal and the &lt;strong&gt;disfigured&lt;/strong&gt; outlines of the homes with people once lived. Nearby in Mykolaiv, a Russian rocket ripped through a government building leaving a gaping hole and fresh trauma.&lt;/p&gt;

It was expected that the President would clean up those unscripted words, instead he clarified that it’s his personal opinion and not a new policy. The concern tonight is that those remarks could escalate the war in Ukraine and P may use it as a propaganda that the West is trying to overthrow him. And there’s news or report from inside Ukraine after a month of indiscriminate bombing that has flattened much of Mariupol. The city’s mayor reportedly says Russian forces have captured the critical port town, but Ukraine has maintained its counterattacks and claims to have retaken a key suburb and an eastern town from the Russians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The President’s comments about V.P came at the end of a carefully prepared speech in three days of intense diplomacy. Today, he said the message was intended for the Russian people. Two days since saying this about V.P “For god’s sake, this man cannot remain in power” President B today clarified he was expressing personal views, not a change in US policy. Still, the President faced a barrage of questions today about his comments like why do you say it? The President’s European trip included high stakes talks with allies and face-to-face meeting with Ukrainian refugees now in Poland. After meeting some them in Saturday, the President also said this about P “he is a butcher”. Taken together, the President’s comments signal at least a rhetorical escalation that critics fear could intensify the conflict. P’s top spokesman called Mr. B’ comments “alarming” said the Russian people pick their leader. And French President E.M who’s in closer touch with P than most world leaders, said he wouldn’t use those terms because he hopes the war can be solved without escalation. But the President disagrees with E.M. White House aides say the President’s remarks about removing P wasn’t part of the prepared text. And is the President worried P will see the comments as an escalation? “I don’t what he thinks, he is going to do what he is going to do”. So as the war in Ukraine continues, the Pentagon announced today it’s sending so-called Growler aircraft that can jam or confuse enemy radar to Germany. The planes won’t be flying over Ukraine but as part of NATO’s deterrence against Russia.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 03.27.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.27.22/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Mar 2022 18:56:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.27.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;President B’s strong words for V.P are &lt;strong&gt;reverberating&lt;/strong&gt; around the world, that includes warnings from some allies about reckless rhetoric following Russia’s &lt;strong&gt;unprovoked&lt;/strong&gt; invasion of Ukraine. In Poland Saturday, President called Putin a dictator quote “who cannot remain in power”. Today, the United Nations estimates that at least eleven hundred civilians have died and more than ten million have been displaced in the war that has gone on far longer than the Kremlin expected. This weekend Ukraine’s President V.Z accused the West of cowardice for its failure to provide war planes and tanks. Ukraine’s military says Russian troops are now regrouping in the north and may aim to split the country. And even the smallest gains on the ground come at a shockingly high cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than a month of fighting has left Russian forces stalled outside the capital and while Russia claims to have turned its main focus towards the East. We’re still seeing a constant barrage of artillery fire and aerial bombings across the country. What Russia lacks in military strategy, it makes up for in &lt;strong&gt;boastful&lt;/strong&gt; videos like this one claiming to show off the cruise missiles hitting to Zhytomyr, one hundred miles west of Kiev. But for Ukrainians at the receiving end of this constant bombardment from the sky, it’s hell on Earth. The coastal city of Mariupol has been decimated, reduced to twisted skeleton of steel and the hollow out of shells of apartment building blocks. Hasty burials provide fleeting dignity for the dead. The one hundred thousand people still trapped there, have no electricity, baring little food, and spend their nights in icy bedrooms.&lt;/p&gt;

In a major speech in Poland, the President delivered a forceful denunciation of V.P. Mr. B appears to call for regime change, but the White House later set back. Earlier today, President met with refugees who have fled the fighting. There, Mr. B did mean ??? his words, calling P a quote “butcher”. The President’s comment came as Russia’s missiles hit the western Ukraine’s city of Lviv, not far from the border with Poland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For god’s sake, this man cannot remain in his power”. Shortly after B’s speech, the White House officials sought to walk that back saying “The President’s point was that P cannot be allowed to exercise his power over his neighbors or the region, he was not discussing P’s power in Russia, or regime change”. More than two million Ukrainian refugees have now streamed in to Poland. President B met with some of them today at Warsaw soccer stadium, it’s being transformed into a refugee processing site where they can go and get food, healthcare and enroll their children in schools. This woman told President B that her city has been erased from the face of the earth. At the royal castle, we met M, whose parents are still stuck in southern Ukraine. As bombs continues to fall, Ukraine’s Foreign Minister and Defense Minister made a rare and risky journey out of their country today in order to meet face to face here with the leader of the free world. They also attended his speech where President B warned the West that this war can last a long time.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 03.25.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.25.22/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Mar 2022 17:11:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.25.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;President B is in Poland preparing what’s being billed as a major speech tomorrow on state of the war in Ukraine on humanitarian crisis. Today, the President met with Polish counterpart and thanked the nation that has welcomed about two thirds of the nearly four million Ukrainian refugees. President B spent time with members of the Army’s eighty second airborne division stationed near the border with Ukraine as a show of force to V.P. There is some big news tonight about the effort to further isolate Russia, the US and the European Union unveiled a deal to diminish Europe’s reliance on Russian energy and it comes as we learned that P maybe shifting strategy focusing on control of Eastern Ukraine and stopping the fight for the capital of Kiev for now. Also, news tonight, the Russians are low on precision guidance missiles and its military has lost half of a dozen generals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US has now stationed more than nine thousand troops here in Poland, President B came here to thank them and to steel them for what could be a prolonged mission here on NATO’s eastern flank. President B came within fifty miles to the Ukrainian border today, and said he wished to get closer. He stopped in Rzeszów, Poland, to share a slice with members of eighty second airborne who are part of the massive aid effort in this town that has now become a processing point for tens of thousands of Ukrainian refugees. 3.7 million people have fled Ukraine in the past month, more than half of them come here, to Poland. Today, the Polish President refer to them as guests. President B called V.P a war criminal, intends to causing civilian suffering. The Defense Department says today it’s seeing the first indication of Russian troops being moved to Ukraine from the former Soviet Republic of Georgia. Pentagon Secretary J.K is traveling with the Defense Secretary here in Poland. Tomorrow, President B will meet with refugees here in Poland, and he will deliver a speech here in Warsaw that his aides say is designed to reassure Polish people that the US is committed to helping huge humanitarian challenge the country is suddenly facing.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 03.24.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.24.22/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Mar 2022 18:32:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.24.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Hours from now, the President B will head to Poland, the country taking in majority of those 3.6 million refugees fleeing war towards Ukraine. President B announced an additional on billion dollars in humanitarian aid that will support people displaced within Ukraine and help countries like Poland handle the influx people crossing the borders. The President hinted in a press conference today that he will also visit refugees. Ukraine’s President Z addressed world leaders from Kiev and pleaded for more military aid including planes, tanks, rockets, air defense systems and other weapons. He told the alliance they were capable of preventing more deaths and Ukraine is defending quote “our common values”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President B said the new red line here in Brussels today, threatening to take unspecified action if V.P as many fears unleashes chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine. President B issued that warning between meetings with his fellow NATO allies and his fellow G7 leaders and the leaders of European Union nations, a diplomatic whirlwind designed to show unity in the face of what could become prolonged Russian brutality. But speaking remotely, Ukraine’s President V.Z told the leaders that he needs more than unity, he needs jets and one percent of NATO’s tanks. He said “You have at least twenty thousand tanks and the worst thing during the war is not having clear answers to requests for help”.
NATO’s Secretary of General wouldn’t commit to the tanks but he said NATO will give Ukraine more equipment to help protect citizens from biological, chemical or nuclear attack. As leaders met, US announced it will take in one hundred thousand Ukrainian refugees but that’s just a small fraction of nearly four million Ukrainians who have fled the deadly conflict so far. The White House also unveiled new sanctions on what it called key enablers of the invasion, including dozens of Russian defense companies and more than three hundred members of Russia’s lower parliament of Duma. The President admitted the crippling international sanctions imposed so far maybe wrecking Russian economy but they haven’t force P to change his course yet.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 03.23.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.23.22/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Mar 2022 17:10:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.23.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;In just a few hours, President B will meet with NATO and European leaders for a historical summit, he just arrived in Brussels for the emergency meeting as West aims to show V.P it is united against his invasion in Ukraine through more military aids and more sanctions on Russia. This comes as the war in Ukraine reaches the one-month mark and Ukrainian resistance surprised many with the Pentagon saying ten percent of Russia’s forces have been taken out. And in another blow to P, a government insider reported quit and left Russia, that’s the highest profile defection so far. Well today, the US took a significant step formally accusing Russian troops of committing war crimes, bombing schools, hospitals and killing civilians. The Secretary of State said America will work with others to prosecute the offenders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CBSN has learned from a senior defense official that Russian have fired more than twelve hundred missiles since war began twenty-eight days ago with devastating effect. From the sky, Mariupol looks like a ghost town. But trapped inside, at least one hundred thousand civilians without food, or water, as Russia intensifies its effort to pound the city into submission. In Chernihiv, Russian bombs obliterated this bridge, cutting off the main escape route for civilians fleeing the horror. And in the country’s second largest city of Kharkiv, the historical center came under attack. And yet, in the face of what the US government now formally calls Russian war crimes, Ukrainians remain defiant. The biggest prize, Kiev, is under daily attack. Today, another residential area was hit. The Russia has suffered heavily losses. NATO estimates seven to fifteen thousand of their men have been killed in action. And now they have been pushing back from Irpin, just outside the capital which has been the scene of some of the fiercest battles, forcing thousands to run for their lives.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 03.21.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.21.22/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Mar 2022 14:52:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.21.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, it is history in the making as the confirmation hearing for Supreme Court nominee judge K.J get underway. The fifty-one-year-old federal appeals court judge for the DC circuit made her opening statements today. Telling Senators that she would work to support and defend constitution and the grand experiment of American democracy. If confirmed, J will become the first black woman on the nation’s highest court. A Harvard Law School graduate J will replace retiring Supreme Court Justice S.B, whom she clerked for back in 1999. J’s confirmation will be groundbreaking in more ways than one, it would be actually the first time four women would be on the court at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, we got a preview of what we can expect the Senators to ask her over the next two days, and then we heard from the nominee to talk about her life and family as she promised, if confirmed, to be independent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the dire warning, President Z remains defiance, saying he is refusing to allow any Russian soldiers to occupy any Ukrainian city despite the horrific damage we seen. Before dawn, a raging inferno, after Russian forces targeted a shopping center in the heart of Kiev. As the sun rose, the devastation was clear to see, the mall is now in ruins, with rescue workers still desperately searching for survivors. To the south, in strategic sea port of Mariupol, more carnage this time on a scale of anywhere else. An estimated ninety percent of city’s buildings have been damaged or destroyed. And yet, Ukraine rejected Russia’s demand to surrender the city at dawn. As the street battles rage on, residents continue to suffer unimaginable horror. For the living, little food, no power and scarcely any medical supplies. And for the dead, some still lie in the streets, while others buried in shallow graves by the side of roads. Despite the horror being inflicted across Ukraine, Russia’s invasion has largely in stalled, what’s been described as a bloody stalemate. Tonight, ten million Ukrainians have been displaced since fighting began, with over three and a half million now refugees abroad making this the worst refugee crisis Europe has seen since World War II.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 03.22.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.22.22/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Mar 2022 14:52:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.22.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, nearly a month after invading Ukraine, Russian forces are on their heels in some areas of the country. Ukrainian forces launched an aggressive counteroffensive in the south today and have retaken a strategically important town just outside the capital of Kiev. Russian troops responded with a &lt;strong&gt;barrage&lt;/strong&gt; of airstrikes on civilian targets in several cities. A senior defense official tells CBSN that the US now has evidence that Russia is deliberately and intentionally targeting civilians including hospitals and evacuation shelters. Ahead of President B’s trip to meet with our NATO leaders on Thursday, the President says V.P’s back is against the wall, however, Ukraine’s resistance and Russia’s slow progress are raising concerns that Putin may resort to using chemical or biological weapons to regain the upper hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three people were killed when this hospital was &lt;strong&gt;decimated&lt;/strong&gt; by a Russian missile strike yesterday according to Ukrainian officials. Ukraine’s government says ten hospitals have now been completely destroyed in this invasion. There is carnage in this country, civilians killed in their homes and on the streets. The US says it’s seen clear evidence the Russians are committing war crimes. Yet Russia’s ground forces have made surprisingly slow progress. Ukraine’s military says it recaptured this strategically important town of Makariv just outside the capital Kiev yesterday, and now fighting to wrest back control of the city Izyum and Kherson according to a senior US defense official. The Ukrainians are massively outgunned but with the anti-tank missile supply by the US and its allies, they destroyed hundreds of Russian armored vehicles and they killed up to nine thousand Russian soldiers according to the US official. Across Ukraine, ordinary people have mobilized to defend towns and villages.&lt;/p&gt;

He described V.P is moving his forces into quote, “wood chipper of Ukrainian resistance.” But invasion now entering its fourth week, it’s a disaster for Ukraine. This is the city of Mariupol, or what’s left of it. And today Ukrainian President V.Z &lt;strong&gt;invoked&lt;/strong&gt; the Holocaust when speaking to Israel’s parliament. He accused Russia of wanting to impose Nazi style final solution on Ukraine. The United Nations now estimates more than ten million people have been forced to leave their homes, that’s over twenty percent of the country’s population. In Rome, Pope Francis visited Ukrainian refugees at this children’s hospital. He said they are suffering quote, “shakes of conscience.” Tonight, Russian forces are intensifying their attacks in the southeast as they continue to dig in elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia’s ground forces may have stalled, but its air and sea assault on southern Ukraine is only intensifying causing horrific damage. These apocalyptic scenes of devastation stretch as far as the eye can see. This is the southeastern city of Mariupol, once home to nearly half million people, now, a wasteland. Even the corpses here remain unburied as Russian forces encircle the strategically important seaport on the Azov Sea. Those afforded the dignity of a burial are put in graves marked only with crude wooden crosses. While for the living, the situation is desperate, with little food, no power or medical supplies. The fall of Mariupol would mark a major win for Moscow, it would allow Russian forces stationed across southern Ukraine to connect with the soldiers in the east of the country. But if this is meant to be a spoil of war, it’s now just the hollowed-out husk of a once great city.&lt;/p&gt;

Six missiles were launched at the western city of Lviv. Ukaine’s defense system took down two of the weapons while the others took a direct hit on the town that is about forty miles from the border with Poland. And as the strikes continues, refugee crisis grows worse by the day. United Nations says more than 3.2 million refugees have now fled the country while nearly six and half million are displaced inside Ukraine. Take a look at this long line of cars fleeing the city of Mariupol, that is the city where a theater was destroyed, more than one hundred and thirty people have been rescued but officials warn that hundreds of people are still trapped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a worrying sign of V.P’s war on Ukraine is only widening, Lviv may now firmly be in his crosshairs following today’s assault. Lviv early morning calm shattered by a Russian cruise missile attack near the city’s airport. It’s a war these children have experienced the worst of. They traveled seventy-two long hours to reach this care home in Lviv, hoping for safety. Originally from Volnovakha, six hundred miles away, it’s been obliterated by Russian forces, thousands of residents of this small but strategically important city near Mariopul were trapped for weeks under the relentless shelling. And these forty-two children are among those were able to escape. But behind the smiles is a trauma made worse by the fact that they have to leave their parents behind. The Ukrainian government could only offer shelter here to the city’s youngest and so their mothers and fathers have to make the agonizing decision to send them here alone, not knowing when the pieces of their families could be put back together again.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 03.17.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.17.22/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Mar 2022 18:26:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.17.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, even with Russia stalling in its invasion of Ukraine, the brutality of Russian forces has shocked the world. The Secretary of State with an ominous message today, warning that V.P. is going more and more desperate and could be preparing to use chemical weapons. On top of the growing death toll, the destruction of Ukraine is vast. A United Nations report just out details more than one hundred-billion-dollar worth of infrastructure has been destroyed in the first three weeks of the war. Here in Washington, the big news is that President B will speak with China’s President Xi tomorrow. The President planning to warn the Chinese leader that his country will bear with responsibility if they support Russia’s aggression and face quote “significant costs”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russian forces have launched one thousand missiles since the start of the invasion, according to senior defense officials in the US as ground forces continue to push towards Kiev. Meanwhile, as Russia continues to launch strikes across the country, there are new signs of Ukraine holding its ground. In an already barbaric war, it was a new low. Bombing a theater in Mariupol where hundreds were taking shelter, despite the word “Children” clearly posted outside. And tonight, rescuer reports many of them have astoundingly survived, some thirty thousand residents have managed to flee the besieged city, but more than three hundred thousand remain trapped amid pitched battles. According the US intelligence since the start of the invasion three weeks ago, more than seven thousand Russian troops have been killed, a dozen of them are here, a refrigerator railcar in Voznesenski, some still teenagers. Perhaps, like so many, they didn’t even know they were going off to war.&lt;/p&gt;

In an historic and emotional speech to Congress, President Z begged for the United States to do more. The former comedian has risen to this moment in history. As Economist wrote today, a man who used to entertain the nation has become its voice. He cited Pearl Harbor and the September 11th attacks in his appeal to members of Congress. And he played this heartbreaking video of Ukraine and its people before and after the Russian invasion, showing the brutality of the airstrikes on civilian targets. For the first time today, B called V.P. a war criminal. Z asked again for a no-fly zone and while President B stopped short of that, he did pledge eight hundred million dollars in military aid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Z thanked the US for all the support it is already provided, but he also made clear it is not enough. President B praised the passionate speech as convincing and significant before offering a reality check about what the US is ready to deliver. An extraordinary sight today as Ukrainian President V.Z. fighting for his country’s survival received a standing &lt;strong&gt;ovation&lt;/strong&gt; from members of Congress. Z begged for help, closing off P’s main pathway to inflicting pain, the sky. Most lawmakers agreed with President B that a no-fly zone is too dangerous, there is growing call to send more fighter jets which the administration has also called risky. In his response, President B didn’t bring up a no-fly zone, or warplanes, but announced additional eight hundred million dollars in military aid. The package includes US made killer drone as known as switchblades that can target Russian tanks from miles away, plus eight hundred antiaircraft and nine thousand antiarmor systems. Twenty-five thousand body arm and helmets and twenty million rounds in ammunition. In his final plea, Z addressed President B in English. Today marked the first time President B used the phrase war criminal to describe P, Press Secretary J.P. said the President was speaking from his heart.&lt;/p&gt;

Russia’s bombardment of Kiev picked up with nearly constant shelling and airstrikes of residential buildings. A senior defense official says Russia has now fired nearly one thousand missiles. Tonight, Ukrainian President Z will make a direct appeal to Congress for more support. There is also some sad news tonight that more journalists have been killed. Fox news announced the cameraman P was killed during yesterday’s attack injured reporter B who remained hospitalized tonight. Well, the number of refugees fleeing Ukraine has now toped three million, pushing humanitarian aid efforts in neighboring countries like we are in the breaking point. And tonight, the growing list of companies suspending operations in Russia including our own parent company Paramount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a war without rest for the living or the dead. The airway sirens interrupted a funeral for Ukrainian soldiers in the city of Lviv. But now, almost three weeks since the Russian invasion began, these mourners hardly flinch, many now numb to the relentless death. And destruction in Ukraine’s second largest city of Kharkiv more than six hundred buildings have been crushed by shelling since the start of the war. Schools, nurseries, hospitals and homes, this woman can barely be rescued before a Russian jet come back to haunt her. And today, Kiev is once again hit, killing at least four people inside their apartments. The latest violent making it even more stunning that the Prime Ministers from Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovenia are risking their lives to meet Ukraine’s President in the capital. A bold show of support from independents of Ukraine, a country that continues to defy the odds in blood Russia’s offensive despite setback.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 03.14.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.14.22/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Mar 2022 18:21:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.14.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, Russia’s military forces bombed western Ukraine that’s just fifteen miles from the Polish border. President Z will address Congress on Wednesday to plead for more help. And President B could soon be headed here to the region among the potential stops is Brussels, Belgium home to NATO. Also sparking worldwide concern, the news tonight that the Kremlin has asked China for help for military equipment, possibly drones. And if the Chinese were to go ahead and aid Russia in its war, it could pit the world’s largest superpower against one and another. We also have some sad news tonight about western journalist, one American shot and killed, his partner wounded, he was working on a documentary about refugees when he was shot by Russian troops. Also, a reporter from Fox news is hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More explosions tonight, now the fourth round of peace talk took place with no other breakthrough than they plan to resume talk tomorrow. Ukrainian President Z described the talk as difficult but he is still hoping for progress even as fighting rages on. The bombardment of a training base is the farthest Russian have reached yet and the nearest come to hit a NATO ally. It’s part of a dramatic escalation in airstrikes and artillery attacks across Ukraine. Rockets took out a TV tower in Rivne, far west of the capital, killing nine. Early this morning missile strikes in Kiev left an apartment building in flames and rescuer scrambling to save survivors. As Russian troops close in on the capital, video from the Ukrainian Defense Ministry shows soldiers taking up positions and fighting back.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 03.13.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.13.22/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Mar 2022 21:33:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.13.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The White House issued a new warning to Russia today after waves of missiles struck at Ukrainian military facilities just fifteen miles from the border with Poland, bringing the fighting ever closer to NATO’s borders. Dozens of people were killed, hundreds were wounded. There was also heavy shelling in northeast of Kiev. Today, Ukraine’s President V.Z. visited his soldiers at this hospital in the capital as Russian forces advanced on the city. And the among those casualties, American journalist R was killed when Russian troops opened fire on his vehicle near Kiev. It’s been eighteen days now since Russian tanks rolled across Ukraine’s border and airstrikes started &lt;strong&gt;pummeling&lt;/strong&gt; cities and civilians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A war that many fears could spill into other countries has taken a dangerous turn with Russia firing a Ukrainian military base close to the Polish border and the NATO alliance. The sky turned red, witness say when roughly thirty Russian missiles struck the Yavoriv training base in western Ukraine, leaving this &lt;strong&gt;smoldering&lt;/strong&gt; crater. Thirty-five people dead and an escalation of the war now only a few miles from Poland, a key NATO ally. The base was routinely used by US and NATO trainers over the years. Heavy shelling also rained down on Chernihiv in the north and Mykolaiv in the south, where the morgues are now so full, victims are laying out of freezing cold. Among those spared gather here below an abandoned market, their childhood interrupted by an invading army, even though these are Russian speakers the very people P said he wants to protect. If Mykolaiv falls, the next domino is Odessa, the former crown jewel of the Russian Empire, and today Ukraine’s biggest port on the Black Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

Today, Russian forces expanded their attacks, including strikes around Kiev, fierce Ukrainian resistance has made the fight, a slog. This is a new video from Southern city of Mariupol, eight and other cities are being pounded with punishing and destructive shelling and airstrikes. This as the humanitarian situation deteriorates with critical supplies in some places &lt;strong&gt;scarce&lt;/strong&gt;. With the war now entered third week, casualties are adding up, so are Russia’s gains on the ground across Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In here the crucial port of Odessa, the city is bracing for a fight as Ukrainian President accuses Moscow of waging a war of nihilation. A war that once seemed unthinkable is now advancing funeral by funeral. Mothers and wives clutched the hand of these soldiers fallen of defending a country their invaders say does not exist. Invaders killed even more civilians than soldiers say Ukraine as indiscriminate shelling rages across the country slamming into a cancer hospital, homes and families in strategic port city of Mykolaiv. Among those spared these women and children must &lt;strong&gt;cram&lt;/strong&gt; beneath a &lt;strong&gt;derelict&lt;/strong&gt; market inside a basement turned bomb shelter. Two weeks ago, they were playing hide and seek, now they are hiding from banned cluster bomb says the mayor. In this information war, Russia has released its own footage showing the moment it captured the airfield outside of Kiev.

The Russian convoy once stalled outside of the capital Kiev has redeployed to nearby towns and forests. Satellite images show artillery has been moved into firing position. Military analysts fear this could be a &lt;strong&gt;prelude&lt;/strong&gt; to the encircling of Kiev and a punishing siege. The &lt;strong&gt;tempo&lt;/strong&gt; of airstrikes on residential neighborhoods with inevitable civilian casualties has increased. Among the targets, a kindergarten and apartment complex in eastern Ukraine. Two and half refugees have fled Ukraine. Tens of thousands of others remain trapped by artillery and missile blasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s clear tonight that Russian forces are edging closer to the capital, explosions are becoming louder and more frequent and new satellite images show units deploying closer to the city, and it comes Russian troops advance across the country. Russia widened its punishing military offensive and extended its reach today. Unleashing air strikes and bombarding new cities like Dnipro for the first time since the invasion began and closed in on areas already in its grip like some of the suburbs surrounding the capital where residents fled in terror. Preparing for the kind of siege already underway in Ukraine’s second largest city of Kharkiv, where Russia too is paid a heavy price. Evidence in the bodies of its soldiers laying face down in the snow. In that horrific air strike on the maternity hospital in Mariupol and haunting images of a wounded pregnant woman, she gave birth to a baby girl today. Hospitals are supposed to give some level of protection in times of war and obviously a civilian target.

Officials say at least three people were killed in that attack including a young girl. Russian forces continue their advance on the capital of Kiev, but here, you can see Ukraine’s military is fighting back appearing to open fire on a column of Russian tanks. US official warned Russian forces are operating with quote “a rapid disregard for civilians as they continue their constant bombardment of residential neighborhoods.”. Two weeks of shelling has left large sections of the country in ruins and thousands of residents now stranded without food, medicine, heat and the electricity. More than 2.3 million refugees have escaped to neighboring countries, many to Poland, some of them today met with Vice President K.H.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Russian government again declared a cease fire and a humanitarian corridor starting tomorrow in five cities including here in the capital and the besieged city of Mariupol. But tonight, the Deputy Prime Minister said not a single civilian was able to leave that city today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A day after the airstrike ripped through the maternity hospital in Mariupol, no mercy in respond from Russian Foreign Minister. On a visit to neighboring Poland, Vice President K.H. joined calls for Russia to be held accountable. She also sought to reinforce US ties with NATO, amid a disagreement with Poland’s proposal to provide Ukraine with old Soviet year fighter jets. Russian troops continue to advance to the capital itself, Northeastern Kiev, a drone video alleges to show a column of Russian tanks coming under fire and turning back. Despite heavy losses, militarily Russia still has the upper hand. Today, Ukraine’s Information Minister asked America and its allies to close down the airspace once again so Ukrainians could fight on the ground. Russian forces are slowly closing in here in the capital, now within just a few miles. Tonight, the mayor says half the city has already fled, as we’ve seen for ourselves. The rest are either taking up fighting positions or taking shelter in hoping for the best.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 03.09.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.09.22/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Mar 2022 21:16:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.09.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, the brutality of war in Ukraine reaches a new level of what the White House called a barbaric use of military force against innocent civilians. At least seventeen people were wounded after a Russian airstrike destroyed a maternity hospital in the city of Mariupol. Ukraine’s President Z said there were children under wreckage and called the strike a war crime. Near the city of Kharkiv, a senior defense official tells CBSN that Russian forces have made moderate progress. And the capital of Kiev, thousands of civilians are making their way to safety while a top Ukrainian advisor said cease fire in many other regions are not holding. And new fears tonight of a possible radiological disaster at two nuclear facilities that are now under control of Russian forces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A day that began in the hope of a limited cease fire ended in horror, a senior defense official says tonight that there are indications that the Russians are using dumb bombs unguided weapons increase civilian casualties and damage. A massive airstrike shattered the fragile cease fire in Mariupol this afternoon. Emergency team and soldiers scrambled to evacuate to wounded, including pregnant women from the city’s maternity hospital, a hospital for those who needing care, maybe the only place where they felt some measure of security, but it seems nothing is off limits to the Russian onslaught. The blast destroyed the complex inside and out, the shattered nursery of blood stain mattress. The size and the depth of crater in the surrounding debris and destruction, evidence of its ferocity. The besieged port city in the South has come under to bombardment that’s cut off electricity and water to more than four hundred thousand people. City officials say at least twelve hundred civilians have been killed since the war began.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 03.08.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.08.22/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Mar 2022 17:26:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.08.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We’re following heavy firing in Eastern Ukraine, fighting that is leaving innocent Ukrainians trapped and unable to flee. This as the civilian’s death toll is growing. President Z saying today at least fifty children have been killed in the first thirteen days of the war. And the humanitarian crisis is worsening, the number of people leaving the country now tops two million and half of them are children. Kiev and other major cities remain under constant bombardment from missile strikes and long-range artillery. Help could soon on the way after Poland announced a deal that could send ultimately MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine, but the Pentagon is raising serious concern tonight about that proposal. Well, nearly two weeks since the invasion, Russia has captured only one major city despite two hundred thousand troops in and around the country. The CIA Director told the Congress today that is why V.P. is angry and frustrated. The dictator planned on a quick and decisive victory is now likely to double downed and quote” With no regard for civilian casualties.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Russian government announced another cease fire here in the capital and four other cities starting from tomorrow morning to allow for the evacuation of civilians. While there was some limited success today is also skepticism. The cease fire came too late to save the lives of two children pulled from the rubble in Sumy. Among the bodies of at least twenty-one people killed in the Russian airstrike overnight, the officials say. Today, a brief break in fighting allowed the evacuation of thousands of people including foreign student travel trapped at the university for days. But the cease fire of besieged southern port city of Mariupol collapsed amid renewed shelling for the third time. Hundreds of thousands of residents at the mercy of Russian onslaught in catastrophic conditions. On the outskirts of the capital itself, in Irpin, thousands of people took shelter beneath a downed bridge today joined a massive evacuation with the help of soldiers and aid agencies. In an emotional address to British Parliament today, Ukrainian President Z echoed Churchill and quoted Shakespeare saying to be or not to be.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 03.07.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.07.22/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Mar 2022 20:07:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.07.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, the war in Ukraine has entered a new phase of brutality as Russia seems to be targeting civilians trying to flee the country. The unprecedented shelling of areas where people are evacuating is sparking fear and outrage, negotiations are going between the two sides but little progress has been made. Meanwhile, the humanitarian crisis is growing by the hour as millions flee their homes in hopes of scaping the violence. As of tonight, at least 1.7 million refugees have fled Ukraine in the first eleven days of the war, and that number is expected to top five million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UN estimates tonight, there have been at least twelve hundred civilian casualties since the war began, and that number thought to be higher and also climbing as shelling increases across the country. A Russian jet goes down in flame over the besieged city of Kharkiv as Ukrainian resident’s cheer. Ukrainian troops on the outskirt of the capital opened fire in the effort to keep the Russian advance at bay. But cities are under siege, like Mariupol, the residents have been unable to flee after two cease fires war shattered. Today, at least two thousand people made across to relative safety. Now those explosions are getting closer to the hospital too, even as they are treating the wounded. The World Health Organization has verified that at least fourteen hospitals have come under attack.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 03.06.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.06.22/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Mar 2022 17:02:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.06.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, Russian forces are intensifying airstrikes and the shelling of cities across Ukraine. Their targets reportedly include civilians. Today, US Secretary of State A.B. said Russia’s actions could constitute a war crime. Today, Ukraine’s President urging resistance with Russian forces closing in on Kiev. And in Russia, new antiwar protests and crackdowns, more than forty-six hundred people arrested in over sixty cities. And tonight, more sanctions targeting Russia from global corporate giants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no escape from Mariupol. A temporary cease fire that should have allowed the safe of evacuation of as many as two hundred thousand residents was shattered by renewed shelling for the second day in a row, both sides blaming each other for opening fire. The southern port city has been a target of a sustained and merciless Russian bombardment for days. The city’s hospital cannot keep up with the amount of civilian casualties. A young man rushes into the emergency room, cradling his eighteen months old son injured in shelling. Emergency teams do everything they can but the little boy cannot be saved. His mother breaks down in tears almost collapsing in grief and then kisses his child goodbye. Russia’s offensive has gathered pace advancing ever closer to the capital itself, residents are digging in and preparing for the worst. Volunteers provide hot drinks and stew.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 03.05.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.05.22/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Mar 2022 17:43:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.05.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Today, the President of Ukraine remains defiant even as invading Russian forces push deeper into this country. Again today, V.Z. pleaded more help from the US and international allies including a no-fly zone over Ukraine. Today, near Moscow, Russian President V.P. warned the west that moved would be act of war. And in Ukraine, the fight is intensified, this video reportedly showing a Russian cruise missile exploding after being intercepted by Ukrainian air defenses. While this residential building is reportedly hit by a Russian missile. There are new images today of the massive exodus. These people huddling for safety among the ruins of a bridge, roughly 1.4 million Ukrainians now refugees outside their country. The largest humanitarian crisis in Europe since World War II.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia thought the invasion would be over swiftly, that was before their jets were &lt;strong&gt;plummeting&lt;/strong&gt; from Ukrainian skies to the cheering of locals. This downed pilot was asked his ranking unit details by his captors. In the face of an impossible odds, Ukraine’s resolve has shocked the world, and frustrated Russians into using banned weapons like cluster bombs. Russia claims they are not hitting civilians releasing videos of missiles launching at precision targets. But on the ground evidence tells a different story. Even nuclear power plants aren’t safe, US officials said the world narrowly avoided a catastrophe during Russian siege of Europe’s biggest nuclear facility. It could’ve been ten times worse than Chernobyl disaster, according to Ukraine. All of it sparking Europe’s worst humanitarian crisis this century. More than one million refugees have fled the country and the UN fears more than four million people about ten percent of Ukrainian population could displaced in the coming weeks. Dozens come into this shelter, here in the western city of Lviv before leaving the country.&lt;/p&gt;

The middle of the night attack on the facility sparked fears of the disaster, the Ukraine officials warned would be ten times larger than Chernobyl. The good news tonight is there are no reports of spikes in radiation. We’re also learning tonight from the Pentagon that the Russian fired more than five hundred missiles so far with NATO says the worst is yet to come. And the attack is getting even more brutal. There are reports of Russian soldiers rapping women and NATO says the Russians are using cluster bombs which are against international law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a late night address moments ago, President Z frustrated of NATO’s refusal to impose no-fly zone over Ukraine had harsh words to say, quote” All the people who died starting from this day will die because of you”. Nothing is off limits to Russian military machine even nuclear power plants. US officials say the world only narrowly avoid a nuclear catastrophe during the violent siege of Europe’s biggest nuclear facility. President Z called the attack terror on unprecedented level. Russian tanks knew what they were firing at he said, directly aiming at the station. After a slow start, the Russian invasion is now baring down with fighting that is raging across the country, destroying cities neighborhoods and lives in its path. To the north in Chernihiv, residential leveled after days of Russian shelling. South to the besieged port city of Mariupol, where paramedics scrambled to save the lives of civilians caught up in days of heavy fighting. Today, the NATO Secretary General accused the Russian military of using banned weapons. Increasing numbers of Ukrainian soldiers have begun to arrive in Kiev hospitals as frontline fighting closes in capital itself. As fears of an all-out invasion climbs, residents by the tens of thousands swarm the capital train station, desperate to get away while they can. Families are torn apart, most of the men staying behind to fight. Parents trying to consult frightened children, couples shared one last goodbye. There has been a dramatic increase in tensions across the country and the city in the past twenty four hours.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 03.03.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.03.22/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Mar 2022 17:58:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.03.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, as the war in Ukraine enters the second week, Russian troops are surging into the country, a senior Defense Department official tells CBSN that ninety percent of the forces that were at the border have now been deployed into battle. Russian troops have stepped up their brutality with an increased bombardment in major cities and civilian areas. Missile strikes are targeting residential neighborhoods, as entire apartment buildings have been leveled. And a shocking revelation speaking in Vienna today, an US government official said the US had credible information that the Russians were keeping lists of Ukrainians to be killed or sent to camps following their military occupation. The humanitarian crisis deepens as Ukraine surpasses the grim milestone of more than one million refugees who have fled across the border to neighboring countries in the last week. The US Ambassador to the United Nations suggests the number could increase to five million before it’s over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President V.Z. once again pleaded for more international supports today, asking once again for US and NATO propose a no-fly zone here saying if not, at least please send me some planes. Civilians once again bore the brunt of Russia’s full-scale assault with missiles slammed into residential neighborhoods in the northern city of Chernihiv. Emergency services say at least thirty-three people were killed. A dashcam video captured the moment of multiple rockets shattered homes on city streets. With the sheer destruction from Russia’s bombardment now stretching for miles across several cities, we’re learning more about massive explosions that lit up the sky here just as we finished last night’s reporting. The military said its defense system intercepted at least two Russian missiles midair before they could strike their intended targets in the city. While Russian troops have taken control of the port city of Kherson, they are closing in fast on Mariupol. Today, President P did acknowledge Russian military is taking casualties, and promised fifty thousand dollars for the families of fallen soldiers. The Pentagon says the Russians have launched more than four hundred eighty missiles since the invasion began. Today, President B accused Russian forces of firing on civilians indiscriminately.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 03.02.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.02.22/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Mar 2022 18:18:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.02.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The White House announcing new sanctions against Moscow for what President B calls Putin’s war of choice and the Justice Department launching a taskforce to go after Putin’s inner circle of billionaire Russian oligarchs. Meanwhile the Russian military has intensified its bombardments in major cities across Ukraine, while its forty-mile convoy heads toward Kiev and it remains stalled due to fuel and food shortages. A senior US Defense official says the Pentagon believes the Russians are regrouping and rethinking their plans but still intend to surround and capture Ukraine’s capital. The massive humanitarian crisis goes larger by the day. There is nearly nine hundred thousand refugees had fled the fighting to nearby countries. And Ukraine’s emergency service claims more than two thousand civilians had been killed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the White House, where anti-Russia protest just outside the gate, appeared to become a permanent fixture. Tonight, the White House is going directly after the heart of Russia’s economy, the oil industry. President B today moved to squeeze Russia’s biggest export, oil, restricting Russia’s ability to buy the technology it needs to refine oil at current levels. Russia’s indiscriminate bombing of civilian targets intensified today, prompting a dramatic vote in UN general assembly. One hundred and forty one to five, demand Russia withdraw its troops from Ukraine. Exxon, Boeing and Siemens joining a growing list of corporate giants pulling back on Russian business. In an extraordinary interview with SKY News, a top Kremlin foreign policy advisor broke ranks and denounced the invasions. As President B foreshadowed in his State of The Union address last night, the Justice Department launched a new taskforce today, dubbed KleptoCapture to investigate and prosecute oligarchs who try to evade sanctions. The steps that the White House took today could slow Russian oil production in the future, but not right away because the White House worried about doing anything that could caused shortages in Europe or drive the price crude oil even higher than it is already.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 03.01.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.01.22/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Mar 2022 16:30:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-03.01.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;In a short time, President B will deliver his first State of the Union address amid growing challenges both at home and abroad. Russia’s war with Ukraine is escalating with missile attacks against government buildings and accusations of war crimes leveled against the Kremlin. Human rights groups saying troops are targeting hospitals and schools and the US officials tell CBSN that Russian forces could isolate the city of Kiev in a week and take the capital thirty days after that. The President spoke by phone today with Ukraine’s President Z for about thirty minutes. The State of the Union speech which is traditionally heavy on domestic issues, tonight will begin with Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President B will go directly after the Russian President tonight and according to excepts just released he will say that V.P. miscalculated quote “He thought the West and NATO wouldn’t respond. And, he thought he could divide us here at home. Putin was wrong, we were ready.” This high-profile speech has been written and re-written and re-written again in response to changing world events.
President B &lt;strong&gt;donned&lt;/strong&gt; a blue and yellow tie today, Ukraine’s national colors as he spoke by phone with Ukraine’s President hold up in an underground bunker. Z said they discussed his need of more defense assistance, as Russian bombing intensifies. The US and its allies unleashed more economic firepower. Today, Apple halting all products sales in Russia, as Visa and Mastercard block Russian banks from their networks. Ford suspended operations in Russia following GM’s lead. And the operator of the new Nord-Stream II natural gas pipeline from Russia to Germany filed for bankruptcy in the face of crippling sanctions. But fears of worldwide shortage forced oil prices up more than ten percent today, in their highest level seven years, even after other oil producing nations including the US agreed to release sixty million barrels of cruel from their reserves. A gallon of gas now cost twenty cents more than it did just a month ago. The State of The Union address can be a polarizing affair, but tonight, both sides are showing solidarity with Ukraine. One hundred and fifty lawmakers &lt;strong&gt;donned&lt;/strong&gt; blue and yellow for a photo on the Capital steps earlier today.&lt;/p&gt;

Tonight, President B was asked directly should be Americans worry about nuclear war? The President telling our CBSN correspondent no. But V.P. is increasingly isolated, sitting alone on end of a long table far away from his own advisors. And today, more than half a million refugees leaving their homes in Ukraine, we’re reminded about the cost of war and the impact on families, especially children. The tears fell down of this young boy cheeks after leaving his father who is fighting in Kiev. While tonight V.P. is under investigation for possible war crimes. Russian forces are still battling to takeover Ukraine’s biggest cities, but they are meeting stiff resistance. But two sides sat down for their first face to face talk in Belarus, the only thing they agreed on was to meet again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight, Russia is accused of war crime, Ukraine’s UN Ambassador accusing Russia of using thermobaric bombs, the most devastating weapons short of nuclear weapons. It&amp;rsquo;s a violation of international law and escalates this conflict to an unthinkable level. Ukraine’s demand for an immediately cease fire went ignored this evening with Russian artillery opening up around Kiev. And tonight, worrying development is that Russian troops are tightening the noose. Satellite images reveal a seventeen miles long Russian military convoy headed to Kiev, now less than twenty miles outside the capital. Ukrainian forces are hitting back everywhere they can. The Defense Ministry releasing drone footage, striking another convoy in Southern Ukraine. The Interior Ministry says multiple Russian missile strikes in a residential neighborhood in the second largest city Kharkiv killed dozens civilians. As the attacks escalate, so too does the civilian death toll, emergency teams race to save the life of six years old girl, injured by Russian shelling while shopping for grocery with her parents. Her frantic mother can only watch on, despite their best efforts, they were unable to save her. Bracing for an onslaught, residents in the capital took advantage when officials lift the curfew since Saturday to stock up foods and supplies. President Z has made a late-night address, and he is pointed the finger directly at President P, blaming him for what he called a brutal attack in Kharkiv today. He is asking the world to enforce a no-fly zone over Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 02.27.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.27.22/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Feb 2022 19:17:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.27.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, the Pentagon is criticizing V.P.’s decision to put his nuclear forces on high alert as quote “unnecessary and escalatory”. This as the US and European allies seek to further punish Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. That includes tough financial sanctions and new flight bans. Still, Russian forces are pushing deeper to Ukraine, resistance has reportedly been fierce and in some places fighting street to street. But Russia forces are advancing, these new satellite images you see there show columns of military equipment forty miles hours outside the capital of Kiev and closing in. Today Ukraine’s President V.Z. agreed to negotiation with Russian officials without preconditions. As the fighting rages, the United Nations reports nearly four hundred thousand people have fled the country, most of them women and children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In just a few short days, Ukraine has transformed to a war zone. One Russian missile hit an oil depot on the outskirt of capital Kiev early this morning according to Ukrainian officials. And in Kharkiv, just twenty miles from the Russian border, there’s been fighting on city streets. The Ukrainian authority said today they were still in control. Yesterday in Kiev, the battle came very close to us, we were inside a private hospital which is now canceled all elective surgeries. Instead, Doctor P told us, they prepared to treat combat injuries. Ukraine’s resistance has been determined, and may have taken Moscow by surprise. Ukrainian volunteers have taken up arms, and made Molotov cocktails at the request of their government. Many Ukrainians have been living in subterranean existence, sleeping in subway stations to shelter from Russian missiles and airstrikes. And nearly four hundred thousand have already fled the country according to the United Nations. Lines at border crossing stretched for miles. Today, Ukraine’s Foreign Minister said that V.P. has so far failed to achieved any of his goals in this invasion, with Russian forces not getting control any more Ukrainian cities.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 02.26.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.26.22/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Feb 2022 16:39:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.26.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, the US and European allies took aim at Russia with unprecedented sanctions, further punishing the Kremlin for invading Ukraine. Millions more the US military aid is also on the way. Across Ukraine today, more heavy fighting, some of it street to street. Russian forces captured more rural territory, but their pushing to cities is proving much harder. Reports describe Ukrainian resistance as fierce. Today, Russian military missiles struck residential building in the capital of Kiev, but the city is not going down without a fight. Ordinary citizens gathered to make Molotov cocktails and Ukrainian President remains defiant, vowing to defend his country again today. But the Ukrainians are badly outgunned and casualties on both sides adding up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the capital under siege, residents here are embracing another way of aerial bombardment. But the Russian ground assault has met with ferocious resistance from Ukrainian forces. And not just around Kiev, but in other parts of country too. The all-out battle for the capital has only intensify it. Ukraine’s Foreign Minister said a Russian missile slammed into apartment building in Southwest of Kiev early this morning, tearing through five floors in the high rise. We went out today to find a huge hole punched into the corner of the building. Firefighters on the scene, shell shocked residents dragging belongs through broken glass in debris scattered everywhere. The mayor has told the residents of this city to seek shelter at home, don’t go out and stay away from the windows, but many people are scared, some of them come here to the deepest subway station in the city about as close as you can get to bomb shelter. The overnight curfew that had been in placed has now been extended from 5 PM today to 8 AM on Monday. Ukrainian Security teams are checking everyone on the lookout for Russian saboteurs. When we were out on streets today, we came across very jittery Ukrainian checkpoint guards, they had their guns drawn even on us, everybody here is on edge. The mayor says anybody caught outside between now and Monday morning, will be considered as enemy.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 02.25.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.25.22/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Feb 2022 20:04:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.25.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;First in Ukraine, Russian forces have entered the capital city of Kiev, and so has the booming sounds of missile and rocket attacks. Emergency crews raced to put out fires following attacks on residential buildings, while debris from a down plane litter the streets. Ukrainian forces are putting stronger resistance than expected that’s according to a senior defense official. Now we’re learning Russian troops are not advancing as fast as anticipated. The B administration, European Union and Great Britain have all moved today to freeze the assets of top Russian leadership, including President P and Foreign Minister, S.L..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the national address, the Ukrainian President warned tonight, will be the hardest battle. We’ve heard a number of powerful explosions tonight, the worst yet. People been told how to make Molotov cocktails. Eighteen thousand guns have been handed out to citizens. He said we cannot afford to lose the capital. Skies lit up tonight over the capital in the most intense and sustained aerial bombardment the city has seen since the invasion began. Kiev on the verge of all-out assault. Even with Russia bear down, President V.Z. was on the streets this evening in defiance, saying your President is here, despite saying earlier that the enemy has identified me as the number one target. Columns of tanks have been seen in the city, and horrific cellphone footage showing the tank crushing a car. A later rescue scene shows the driver miraculously survived. Russian troops are tightening the &lt;strong&gt;noose&lt;/strong&gt; on Kiev after going on the attack against Ukrainian forces on multiple fronts across the country. Fierce fighting in Kharkiv, Russian soldiers capturing Chernobyl nuclear power plant site, accused of taking hostages. Tens of thousands have tried to flee instead. Ukrainian guards fired warning shots to prevent a stampede at the city’s main train station. While those left to hunker down in the capital can only brace from the onslaught to come. After moving at lightning speed when the invasion first began, the Russian advance had been bogged down. Ukrainian forces are not going down without a fight. The man we spoke to today, vowed to fight to the end to stop Russian troops from taking over this city.&lt;/p&gt;

This is the nightmare in the scenario that the world feared, the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, that tonight is underway. V.P. unleashed a tidal wave violent across Ukraine, firing one hundred and sixty short range and medium range missiles according to a senior defense official. And at least a hundred and thirty Ukrainian have been killed and hundreds wounded. But those numbers are expected to surge in the days ahead. Fierce fighting is happening along several frontlines as Russian forces move into Ukraine from three sides. And tonight, they are advancing on the capital of Kiev. These new images show first pictures of damage inside Ukraine, military installations and airports have been targeted but so have the civilian’s apartment buildings and hospitals. Roadways are jammed as civilians come to flee large cities while subway stations have turned into bomb shelters. President B announced new round of punishing sanctions and the deployment of seven thousand additional new US troops to Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been a tough day for Ukrainian forces, they have been fighting Russian troops on multiple fronts, now we are getting late word tonight that those Russian forces are advancing on the capital itself on day one of its invasion. Air raid sirens and explosions shattered the peace today. In a conflict that will send shockwaves far beyond the battlefield to Ukraine in the biggest attack in the European country nearly eighty years. This is what V.P.’s operation to demilitarize the country looks like after declaring war in a pre-dawn announcement. Tonight, we were told a major battle is underway at the Gostemel Airfield on the outskirt of the capital itself where Russian paratroopers swooped in today. President of Ukraine confirming paratroopers had landed, saying Russian airborne troops are surrounded. But one battle they lost was for the former Chernobyl nuclear power plant around sixty miles from the capital, now fully in the hands of Russians. The clashes followed a campaign of aerial bombardment across the country. Russia says its forces hit more than seventy military targets across Ukraine, but then you find something like this, shattered glass everywhere, destroyed billboard apparently not everything hit its target. None the less, the President P boasted in the declaration of war this morning, Ukraine and NATO allies are only too aware that Russia is one of the strongest nuclear powers in the world, an ominous threat. That first bombardment triggered a mass exodus from the capital today, if it happens again tonight, those who remained in the city, might be the next to flee. Now the Ukrainian government has declared martial law with a curfew in place from 10 PM to six AM and they are expecting another round of airstrikes to happen here in early hours. President Z is on the television moments ago, he said we are fighting this war alone, he is now barring men from eighteen to sixty from leaving the country.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 02.23.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.23.22/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Feb 2022 16:51:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.23.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We’re going to begin tonight with much of the world on high alert, waiting and dreading the V.P. and his Russian forces are ready to conduct the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. After one hundred and ninety thousand Russian troops are assembled on Ukraine’s border, and almost all of them are in attack positions. Ukraine has declared state of emergency and called up military reservists. The Kremlin today said rebel leaders in Eastern Ukraine have asked Russia for a military assistance to &lt;strong&gt;fend&lt;/strong&gt; off Ukrainian aggression. While the fear is that Russia will use this as a pretext for direct military involvement in the Eastern Ukraine. And there is new satellite images today that show heavily armed Russian troops on the move less than ten miles from the Ukrainian border. The tension sending stocks into another &lt;strong&gt;nosedive&lt;/strong&gt; today with the DOW at its lowest level of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, there have been a number of cyber attacks here tonight, targeting banks and the foreign ministry. The fear has always been that would be the first sign of military invasion only adding the tensions here. That nationwide state of emergency already went into effect at midnight here. Polices are now warning residents to on alert in case of attack. Ukrainian President’s mobilization of reserve troops. Russia evacuating embassy’s staff in hurry. The Kremlin says separatists have requested help to counter what they say is aggression from the Ukrainian military. A senior defense official telling CBSN that Russia’s military is ready for a full-scale invasion, which could come as soon as tonight, including targeting the capital Kiev itself. And the President P has assembled nearly a hundred percent of the forces, US officials believe, he needed to launch an invasion. US believes Russian troops are now entering the Donbass region of Eastern Ukraine. Ukraine now looks and feels like a country bracing for a full-blown war. At a tank factory in Kiev, we visited today, they have been working overtime. Repairing tanks from frontline fighting, where Ukrainian forces have been battling Russian-backed separatists for years. They not only know the clock is ticking, they are fully aware this factory itself maybe a target if Russia launches a full-scale invasion. The atmosphere here at Kiev has changed tonight, those recent developments, the fighting in the east. It’s no longer a question of if, but when, and that may happen at any time.&lt;/p&gt;

President B specifically calling Russia’s military moves an invasion and has promised the President and European allies to level tough new economic sanctions against Russia financial institutions and oligarchs in P’s inner circle. The President also warning P that if he continues his aggression, there is even more punishment that can be inflicted. Not with soldiers, but more sanctions. In a ceremonial move today, the Russian Duma, that’s the nation’s parliament, gave permission to P to use military force outside the country. Just as these new satellite images just in show that troop deployments are now within twelve miles from Ukraine’s border. Well today’s action set market to a freefall, all three major indexes falling more than one percent, and sending the S&amp;amp;P into the correction territory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight, the White House says that the sanctions imposed today are only the sharp edge of the full pain the US is prepare to inflict. President B emphasizes that if V.P. escalates, so will he. But he stressed that it comes at a cost, a higher energy prices for Americans here at home. Today, President B warned V.P. was laying the groundwork to launch a large-scale incursion into Ukraine. Putin’s decision to send troops to two Moscow backed breakaway regions of Ukraine while recognizing their independence deepened the crisis. In response, the administration announced sanctions against two Russian financial firms and the countries sovereign debt, cutting it off from western financing, plus sanctions on top Putin cronies and their family members. European allies also countered. Germany halted action on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, a top P project that carries natural gas from Russia. But it’s unknown if the new penalties will stop P, who has up to one hundred and ninety thousand troops surrounding Ukraine. And today, in a potentially grim sign of things to come, the Russian parliament authorize the use of military force abroad. Despite pledge not to get into a shooting war with Russia, President B announced he is sending new firepower to the region, up to eight fighter jets and thirty-two helicopters along with approximately eight hundred additional US troops that will beef up NATO’s eastern flank. President B also warned sanctions to Russia could also cause cut off some oil supplies, driving up already high gas prices.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 02.21.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.21.22/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Feb 2022 20:32:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.21.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;War in eastern Europe is getting closer after Russian President V.P. declares the independence of two breakaway regions in Ukraine. After the announcement, Putin ordered a quote “Peacekeeping Operation” to began in the two regions. That would mean the deployment of Russian troops and weapons into those areas. One US officials tell CBSN this could be a precursor to a larger invasion or this could be Putin’s only move. In an hour-long speech, Putin demanded that Ukraine immediately end its military operations in the east of country or face responsibility from possible bloodshed. The White House said the President B is imposing financial sanctions in response, NATO, the United Nations, the European Union and the United Kingdoms all condemned Putin’s decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight, President B is also condemning those latest moves by V.P. and vowing to response additional even more severe economic penalties. But the White House is still scrambling to find a way stop Putin from launching a full-scale attack, which appears to be more likely by the hour. Tonight, new signs that the military invasion could be imminent. Russian President V.P.’s decision to recognize the independence of two separatist regions in eastern Ukraine and his order to have the Russian military conduct so called Peacekeeping Operations there. It’s raising fears that this is the first wave of a larger attack. The White House respond by saying President B will impose sanctions on anyone doing business in those two republics. While European allies slammed Putin’s move as a violation of international law, and say they, too, would respond with sanctions. In a late-night address, Putin delivered a lengthy rejection of Ukraine sovereignty, slammed NATO refusal to ban the country from ever joining and callout the US for having missile abilities near Russia. With crisis escalating, President B huddled with his national security team today and had an emergency call with Ukrainian President Z, plus the leaders of Germany and France. A possible B-P summit, hosted by French President A.M. and tentatively agreed to by the White House looks to be in jeopardy. Putin who oversaw nuclear military drills this weekend, as up to one hundred and ninety thousand troops on Ukraine’s border with nearly half of them in position to attack. US intelligence indicates that the Russian President has already ordered commanders to move into Ukraine. The B administration has pointed ongoing false flag operations, staged by the Russians to frame Ukraine as another sign of escalation. National advisor J.S. acknowledge the chances of diplomatic resolution are diminishing.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 02.20.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.20.22/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Feb 2022 16:40:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.20.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, Americans in Russia are being urged to have an evacuation plan out of country. The US Embassy warns that the threat of attacks in public places including Moscow ??? and along Russian border with Ukraine. That’s where the Kremlin has amassed a massive military force and advanced of an expected invasion on its former Soviet neighbor. CBSN has also learned that Russian commanders have received their orders to attack and they’re getting ready to battle. Today, Russian military exercises in Belarus near Ukraine’s north border were scheduled to end, but now they have been extended. And late today, President B held an emergency meeting with his national security council at the White House. At the nearby Lincoln Memorial, Ukrainian Americans rallied in solidarity with families and friends back home. Many of them demand V.P. facing punishing sanctions now before his aggression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President B has spoken briefly with French President E.M. following a meeting with his national security team. The administration is still hoping for a diplomatic off-ramp??? Warning Russia could pay a stiff price if it chooses war. President B convened his national security team behind closed door at the White House to discuss the escalating crisis between Ukraine and Russia. Secretary of State A.B. is not ruling out a last effort on diplomacy. Russia continues to buildup in Ukrainian border, amassing as many as one hundred and ninety thousand troops and extending military drills with neighboring Belarus. An US Official also paper??? CBSN intelligence shows Russian units have received orders to proceed with an invasion. Ukrainian President V.Z. wants sanctions impose now. But the B administration reiterated it will likely hold off till Russia invades.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 02.19.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.19.22/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Feb 2022 15:12:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.19.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, there are troubling new signs that Russia is on the verge of invading its neighbor Ukraine, putting all of the Europe on edge. Russia’s President V.P. was seen observing a series of nuclear drills today and a mock battle. It happened just north of the Ukrainian border and it involved war planes, tanks and rocket launchers. US officials say to one hundred ninety thousand Russian troops are now amassed along the Ukrainian border, with new deployments in Crimea, Belarus and near Eastern Ukraine. On the frontline, there was an ???uptick in shelling today, Ukraine’s military said two soldiers were killed. Russian separatist leader in Eastern Ukraine ordered the evacuation of women and children, and thousands already fled. At a security conference in Munich, Germany today, Ukrainian President V.Z. begged to the west to pose stiff sanctions now. S met with Vice President who called this a decisive moment in history, one day after President B said he is now convinced P does intend to attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s crunch time and everyone here this weekend knows it. One last shot at diplomacy if the diplomacy still has the shot. Taking center stage of Munich security conference, Ukrainian President V.Z. told the ballroom packed with diplomats and government officials that his country cannot afford to panic. Z’s visit to Munich is short with many Western allies privately advising not to risk leaving Ukraine. But Z says he wanted to make his case himself, in person, pressing the US and European allies to sanction Russia now before it’s too late. Speaking earlier in the day, Vice President said the US and its allies have prepared to impose significant and unprecedented sanctions if Russia further invades Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 02.18.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.18.22/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Feb 2022 15:33:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.18.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Strong words tonight from President B he says he believes that the decision for war has been or already been made by Russian President V.P. The President warning that Ukraine’s capital of Kiev made up of more than 2.8 million people could be a target within days. This is the biggest crisis to face in Europe since the end of Cold War. The latest satellite images show Russian troops moving within ten miles of Ukraine’s border with a deployed helicopter and a ground attack aircraft. Meanwhile, Russian backed separatists have announced evacuation of hundreds of thousands of residents to Russia from a region in Eastern Ukraine. Russian media is also reporting attacks in the region that the US and Ukraine say are stay false flag attack. Russian has increased number of troops in the border to as many as one hundred and ninety thousand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For weeks now, President B has said the US was not positive that the V.P. has decided to invade Ukraine and with all that changed today, as he warned it will likely happen in the coming days. The President vows to implement punishing sanctions to make Russia pay the price, but he also said Putin still has time to change his mind. For the first time, President B left no room for doubt over whether he believes V.P. will launch an invasion of Ukraine. The President reviewed his assessments after holding a phone call with NATO allies amid the administration’s all-out efforts to prevent a war, he said there was reason to believe Russian would invade in the coming days. Secretary of State A.B. and Vice President K.H. are meeting with allies at a security conference in Munich, she is scheduled to see Ukrainian President V.S. on Saturday. But some US officials worry him leaving Ukraine would give Moscow a window to act. Tonight, the White House is also blaming Russia for those cyberattacks in Ukraine that we saw this week against the defense ministry and major banks. National Security officials say they do not have intelligent to indicate Russia is coming after the US now, but they are working with the private sector to secure systems just in case.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 02.17.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.17.22/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Feb 2022 20:43:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.17.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The eyes of the world are on Ukraine tonight. And with close to one hundred and sixty thousand Russian troops still in the attack positions, President B believes that the threat of invasion remains very high. The Defense Secretary today said Russia appears to be setting the stage for war by adding combat aircraft and stocking up on blood supply on the frontlines in case of battlefield casualties. Well tonight, the officials are accusing Russian-backed forces of firing shells at a school in Eastern Ukraine. And in a broadcast exclusive, we are inside that kindergarten. But in the hopes of settling the crisis through the diplomacy, the Secretary of State made unscheduled at United Nations today delivering an impassioned speech and outlining quote, “&lt;strong&gt;theatrical&lt;/strong&gt; steps the US thinks the Kremlin may take”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those developments you mentioned have the President B and top officials deeply concerned that V.P. is on the &lt;strong&gt;verge&lt;/strong&gt; of launching a full-scale invasion. But even as Russian troops inch closer to Ukraine, the B administration is pushing for a diplomatic solution. Tonight, over six thousand American troops are in position in Eastern Europe while the Russian military continues to show off its firepower. The number of soldiers President P has assembled is growing close to one hundred and sixty thousand almost half within thirty miles of the Ukrainian borders. And despite Russian state media showing video of Russian troops withdrawing, Putin has claimed, President B today says he is convinced an invasion is imminent. The President also accused Russia of sparking a so-called false flag operation today in Eastern Ukraine where schools were bombed, but the Ukrainian military and Russian-backed separatist traded blame. Addressing the United Nation Security Council, Secretary of State A.B. said the incident was exactly the US has been warning could happen. Despite the dare warnings, A.B. urged Russia to get to engage in dialog and diplomacy. But the Russian took a different diplomatic approach, expelling the second ranking of American official from the US embassy in Moscow, something US officials called baseless. And in a written response to US security proposal last month, Russia warned that if US and NATO don’t agree to keep Ukraine out of the military alliance, Russia will be forced to response with measures of a military technical nature. Also tonight, Vice President C.H. is in Germany for a major global security conference. Her biggest moment yet on the global stage. Aides say she sets to focus on rally European allies against Russian aggression and plans to meet Saturday with Ukraine’s President.&lt;/p&gt;

Well, the B administration and NATO don’t believe it would be true. In fact, the intelligent is showing something opposite, with some troops moving closer to the border. And this just in, US official now says seven thousand more Russian soldiers have arrived near Ukraine, with some arriving as recently today. The crisis in Ukraine keeps growing by hour and the United States continues to warn that a Russian invasion could happen at any moment. The State Department says Russian propaganda and misinformation could be used as pretext to cross the borders. Soldiers from the 101st Airborne Division at Fort Campbell, Kentucky tonight have been ordered to deploy to Europe as part of what’s called Joint Force Task Dragon with mission to support with NATO allies and partners in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;US officials tell CBSN that it’s likely Russian cyberattack has already targeted Ukraine’s government, military and critical infrastructure to collecting intelligence. It’s feared an invasion could be preceded by devastating cyberattacks. Today, satellite images of Russia’s troops buildup on Ukraine’s border reportedly show heightened military activity, as well as a new pontoon bridge and a large field hospital. Both in Belarus to Ukraine’s north, where Russian carrying out a massive military exercise. Ukraine’s military is estimated to have roughly a quarter the manpower of Russia’s and less than a tenth of Russia’s fighter aircraft. Belarus claims all Russian forces will leave its territory when those military exercises end this weekend. We’ll have to wait and see if that’s true, it might be a better indication Russian intentions.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 02.15.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.15.22/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Feb 2022 18:14:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.15.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We want to begin with what is the biggest security crisis between the west and Russia since the end of the Cold War. In his address specifically about the tensions, President B today reviewed a new number Russian troops now encircling Ukraine. A hundred and fifty thousand soldiers. The President says the US stands prepare to respond and that invasion by Putin would rally the world to oppose its aggression. An US official tells CBSN that Russia moved rocket launchers and long-range artilleries into firing positions yesterday. Earlier today the website of Ukraine Defense Ministry Armed Forces and two state owned banks were brought down by a cyberattack. Ukraine’s government released statement suggesting Russians were the perpetrators and expert have long said an electronic warfare could be a &lt;strong&gt;precursor&lt;/strong&gt; to invasion. There is deep skepticism here in the White House about that &lt;strong&gt;purported&lt;/strong&gt; Russian troops pullback, the President warns, an invasion to Ukraine is still possible. But in a message today for the Russian leaders, give peace a chance. President B said today that he isn’t convinced V.P.’s pulling back Russian troops from the Ukrainian borders. Russian state media today showed what appeared to be some Russian tanks retreated, Putin announced he decided to partially pullback troops. But the US officials called the apparent withdraw a smokescreen. President overviewed there now a hundred fifty thousand Russian troops encircling Ukraine up from one hundred and thirty thousand. The President’s comments came hours after Putin meeting with German Chancellor said he didn’t want war and he wanted to solve the issue as a part of the negotiation process through peaceful means. President B said the diplomacy is still the preferred option, but he made clear, Putin’s demand that Ukraine never become a member of NATO is off the table. Now despite Putin’s claim of pulling back troops and the hopes for diplomatic talks, US officials tell CBSN that an invasion to Ukraine by Russia could still occur maybe this week.&lt;/p&gt;

The pentagon says the President hasn’t made a final decision but that should he choose to, he can move in without little or no warning. That’s part of the reason the State Department is closing the embassy in Kiev and moving diplomats out of harm’s way. We learned today that V.P. flooded the region with thousands of more troops and Russian units in Belarus moved in attack positions along Ukraine’s northern border. And while the Russian buildup points to kind of some military action, President B and British Prime Minister say a window for diplomacy remains open. Invasion fears rattled financial markets and energy experts warned that a war will push gas prices even higher than they are now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The State Department says it’s temporarily closing the US embassy here in Kiev, Ukraine’s capital and moving operations to the city of Lviv near Polish border as a security measure of the quote “dramatic acceleration in the buildup of Russian forces.” In Moscow tonight, perhaps a signal that President Putin is looking for an off ramp from this crisis. Russian Foreign Minister urged him to allow more time for diplomacy in a televised exchange. Yet Russian still moving forward with military drills in Belarus and on the Black Sea. An US official told CBSN some Russian long range artilleries and rocket launchers have been moved into firing positions. Ukraine is now closed to being encircled, US officials say, by roughly a hundred and thirty thousand Russian troops. The absence of panic in Ukraine is nothing short of surreal, its people seemed determined not to be intimidated. Commuters calmly made their way to work this morning, though Kiev’s subway system is also effectively the city’s biggest bomb shelter if there is an attack. It looks like business like usual, but scratch the surface there is worry and sense of being powerless. An US Official said today that once an attack begins, knowledge of what’s happening will dramatically decrease because America will have no people on the ground and no reconnaissance plane in the air.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 02.13.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.13.22/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Feb 2022 16:48:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.13.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Today, President B told Ukraine’s President that the United States and its allies would respond quote “swiftly and decisively” to a new Russian invasion into the country. Diplomatic efforts to defuse the crisis are ongoing but the US warned that the attack is expected and soon. This weekend some airliners began to suspending flights in Ukrainian airspace. Today, a charter jetliner carrying more than US troops from the 82nd airborne division arrived at Poland to bolster NATO presence there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President B and S spoke about an hour by phone today, and both men agreed for continue diplomacy with Russia, but tonight CBSN has learned that B administration is preparing to pull all US personnel out of Kiev in the next twenty-four to forty-eight hours. With almost all the forces it would need deployed Ukraine’s borders, National advisor J.S. said today a Russian invasion could happen at any time. The US has threatened unprecedented economic and political consequences. But so far that threat hasn’t stop Moscow’s massive military buildup. Saturday’s phone call between President B and P produced no major breakthroughs. The State Department has told all Americans in Ukraine to leave the country immediately. But the streets of capital are calm, and President V.S. said the biggest threat to his country is panic. Here in Kiev, life is carrying on pretty much normal with most Ukrainians believing it’s the Kremlin wants them to live in fear, something they refuse to do. But the US says if Russia makes some moves, Kiev will be at risk. A full-scale invasion would come from the North, isolated the capital and other major cities. The east where most of Ukraine’s army is located and the south, where Russian is beginning live fire exercises, that blanket almost the entire coast.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 02.12.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.12.22/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Feb 2022 20:28:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.12.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, President B again warned Russian leader V.P. of the cost of any invasion of Ukraine. More than a dozen nations have urged their citizens to leave the country. Today, more planes carrying US troops from the 82nd airborne division flew into Poland to bolster NATO’s eastern flank. And in Ukraine’s capital, thousands of Ukrainians braved winter cold to rally in Kiev to show unity against the threat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The White House says that calls between two world leaders didn’t produce any major breakthroughs. And a senior ranking official tells CBSN they’re still not sure whether or not V.P. has made the decision to invade. But early this morning the State Department pulled most of its diplomats out of the embassy in Kiev just in case. During the hour-long conversation, the White House says the President B urged President P to engage in de-escalation and diplomacy. But the time for diplomacy is running thin. Traveling in Fiji, Secretary of State says the US still has not received a written response to its security proposals. And Russian now has eighty percent of the troops it would need to invade positioned along Ukraine’s borders. About seven thousand Americans in Ukraine have registered with the State Department. Thirty thousand US troops, however, are headed to join units already positioned in Poland and Romania. With eighty-two hundred on standby to back up other NATO allies in case Putin’s territorial aspirations expand beyond Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s government is telling people to stay calm and united, it also warned that the country is almost fully surrounded by hostile forces.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 02.11.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.11.22/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Feb 2022 19:17:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.11.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We’re going to begin with ominous warnings from the B administration that Russia has the troops in place to possibly invade Ukraine in any time. American citizens should leave the country in the next forty-eight hours. Other countries including Britain are urging their citizens to do the same. As we come on the air, President B is pressing to get on the phone with Russian President V.P. soon in his ongoing attempt to deescalate the crisis which send shock waves through financial markets today. The DOW, NASDAQ and S&amp;amp;P plumbed ???amid on fears of war. Russia for months has been surrounding Ukraine with troops saying it wants to enforce redlines to make sure that its former Soviet neighbor doesn’t join the NATO alliance. Russia is now conducting military drills with neighboring Belarus. Also tonight, the brand new CBSN poll finds us majority of Americans with prefer the US stay out of negotiations with Russia and Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And tonight, CBSN has learned that the US has picked up new intelligences indicating Russian commanders have been told to be ready to a possible invasion by the 16th, that just five days away. Americans living in Ukraine got a blunt warning today, there will be no US rescue operation if they get trapped. US officials call this a sign of escalation, video and satellite images showing more Russian troops arriving at the Ukrainian border, prompting this video call today between President B and a dozen NATO leaders, as US officials urged all Americans in Ukraine to depart now. The state department estimates there are roughly six thousand Americans living in Ukraine. The US has begun polling out personnel from its embassy in Kiev. An US official tells CBSN Russia has now arrayed nearly eighty percent of the forces it needs to launch a full-scale invasion of Ukraine with more troops in route. That’s up seventy-percent just a week ago. The first US military convoy reached neighboring Romania this week as the Defense Secretary ordered three thousand more troops to head Poland.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 02.10.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.10.22/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Feb 2022 19:44:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.10.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, we’re here in London watching the largest troop deployments in Europe since World War Ⅱ British Prime Minister warning &lt;strong&gt;ominously&lt;/strong&gt; today that they’re facing the most dangerous moment in decades. And this news just coming in, US State Department urging Americans to get out of Ukraine now. The growing frustration over the pandemic and the anger over mandates that now has turned into protests. Protests, which are now threatening already fragile supply chain. The B administration telling CBSN that they are working with their Canadian counterparts to resolve border blockages. And the new statement tonight from a group calling themselves the People’s Convoy just announced plans to rally on California on March 5th and then head east to D.C. that following day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re learning that if one of those protests happening in the US, law enforcement is going to be focused on protecting people’s right to protest, but also preventing disruptions across major cities around the United States. What is disrupted tonight, anything trying to cross this bridge, and that includes an awful lot of commerce. Tonight, the trucker blockade in Canada is growing, with vaccine mandate protests closing border crossings in three provinces, bordering Michigan, North Dakota and Montana. In Detroit, the Ambassador Bridge remains closed for a fourth day, cutting off about twenty five percent of all trade between the two countries. Michigan’s governor demanded the Canadian government open the bridge. GM, Ford and Toyota are among several automakers forced to cut production at several plants in the US and Canada, as far away as Kentucky, due to a lack of parts. At MBH Trucking outside Lansing, these trailers are parked instead of making their cross-border runs. The cross Canada protests started nearly two weeks ago. In Ottawa, authorities have still not been able to get the trucks off the streets. Police are now asking for help clearing out the protesters. There are new concerns that a similar trucker convoy could start this weekend at the Super Bowl. CBSN learning tonight that the Department of Homeland Security is surging additional staff to its incident command post there. And it’s not just automakers feeling the impact. The White House is acknowledging tonight, that significant disruptions are being felt by a number of businesses and industries.&lt;/p&gt;

At least nine states in the last few days have moved to end requirements for schools or public places. Today, four more states joined a growing list of governors that have announced plans to repeal or let mask mandates expire. More are expected to follow suit in the days ahead as Americans are eager to return to life before the pandemic. The seven-day average of new cases fell to just two hundred and thirty thousand as of yesterday, that’s the lowest number since December. The CDC today warned states about moving too fast and still recommends indoor mask wearing in places of substantial or high-transmission of the virus. CDC Director said they encouraged by the current trend but quote “we are not there yet”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the pandemic drags on, there are signs of hope tonight that things are getting better but Americans are frustrated. Forty-six percent of those recently polls said it is time to get back to normal. As Covid fatigue continues, Dr. A.F. is sounding optimistic, telling the Financial Times “We are heading out of the full-blown pandemic phase of Covid-19”. This as more states are easing indoor mask mandates. Today, New York, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Illinois all announcing changes joining five other states that announced roll-back this week, Nevada is expected to make an announcement tomorrow. Cases are down nearly forty-four percent from last week and have fallen nearly seventy percent from January 15th when Omicron is peaking. But cases are still more than doubled what they were a year ago. And today, the CDC urged caution. The rollback of mask mandates in schools will take a little longer. Remaining in place until at least the end of the month in some states. With only thirty-nine percent of children are fully vaccinated, the CDC continues to recommend universal masking in schools. Kids in six months old to four years old could be eligible for the vaccine as early as the end of this month. But under federal rules, pharmacies, which played a major role in shot distributions cannot vaccine anyone under three years old creating a potential snag in the rollout.&lt;/p&gt;

The governor of New York is expected tomorrow to repeal the indoor mask mandate for businesses and she could allow schools to do the same by the end of the month if cases continue to drop. It’s too soon to say if America is at a turning point, but two years from the start of the pandemic there is growing recognition that we’re in the endemic stage. And that means learning to live with the Sars Covid Ⅱvirus. According to the latest data, the daily average number of new cases is down nearly seventy percent nationwide in less than a month, so cases are falling. The CDC says the B administration is preparing to rollout ten million mini vaccine doses for children as young as six-month-old. The first round of shipment could arrive by Monday, February 21st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York could join the list states rolling back mask mandates tomorrow, as governor C.H. is expected to make announcement for businesses. She told education leaders today, she is not ready to do the same for schools yet, but that could come in just a few weeks. With only about forty percent of five to seventeen years old full vaccinated. The CDC still recommends indoor masking in schools, regardless vaccination status. In New Jersey, Delaware, Connecticut and Oregon have all announced plans to lift mandates. California will still require masking in schools, but will remove the requirement for vaccinated individuals in indoor public spaces, starting next week. Nationwide, cases are about seventy percent lower than January’s peak, but weekly cases among children still one hundred thousand, a four hundred percent higher than this time last year. Pandemic fatigue and frustration isn’t just impacting schools, it’s in hospitals too. Now Pfizer’s CEO says that he thinks the FDA could fast truck vaccine authorization for children under the age of five, the data is expected on Friday and the FDA advisor committee is set to meet next week about the shots.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 02.07.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.07.22/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Feb 2022 16:59:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.07.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, the first glimmer of hope of what could be the life after the pandemic, three states across the Northeast, once the epicenter of Omicron surge, have announced timelines to end strict Covid mask mandates. The governor of New Jersey, Delaware and Connecticut all made the announcement to end their states in school mask mandates as cases continue their steep decline nationwide. According to Johns Hopkins, the number of new cases yesterday are down more than ninety-five percent from the high of nearly 1.4 million on January 10th. More states are expected to follow soon even as the White House today said the universal mask wearing in schools still stay in their recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Americans are so sharply divided over restrictions, but one after another state leaders are moving to a new normal, even as health officials urge cautions. New Jersey have had the country’s strictest mask mandates in schools until now. Democratic governor P.M. announcing an end to mask mandates in schools. Covid cases there are down eighty-nine percent. But the CDC continues to recommend universal masking in schools. In Illinois, where cases are down seventy-three percent, more than a hundred and forty school districts scrambled this weekend after a judge forced them to drop the state&amp;rsquo;s mask mandate. The ruling came after seven hundred parents sued to stop the mandate. Tonight, Connecticut Governor is dropping their schools mask requirement. On Friday, Delaware’s Governor is ending that state’s indoor mask mandates and lifting it in schools next month. Nationwide, Covid cases are down forty-two percent from just last week. But health officials warn normalcy isn’t here yet. And here in New York, as Covid cases fall, the state’s mask mandate is set to expire on Thursday, with the Governor signaling it could be lifted entirely.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 02.06.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.06.22/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Feb 2022 16:52:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.06.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, there are increasing signs that V.P. plans a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. And the Biden administration now says that could happen at any time. Right now, more than one hundred and ten thousand Russian troops are massed on the border. This weekend US troops from the 82nd airborne division arrived in Poland to demonstrate America’s commitment to NATO’s eastern flank. If Ukraine does become about a battlefield, sources tell CBSN that civilian casualties could go as high as one hundred thousand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the cold bite of winter, some fighters prepare for the worst. But these people are not Ukrainian, they are from the nation of Georgia, a country which also shares ???border and complex history with Russia. The fear of the Russian invasion has triggered a sensitive unity across Ukraine not see in a year. In the second largest city, ???, a vibrant sea of blue and yellow, as thousands took to the street waving Ukrainian flags in the show of patriotic spirits. But those here know it takes much more than patriotism to defend against Russia. The Kremlin continues to insist it has no plan to invade. Despite massing roughly a hundred and ten thousand battle-ready troops along Ukraine’ borders. But at the same time, accusing the US of trying to ??? into war. US intelligent officials say President P still hasn’t decide that whether to invade, but has nearly everything he needs to launch what could be the largest scale military operation in Europe has seen since World War Ⅱ.
Tonight, diplomatic efforts to defuse the crisis are being ??? exploring in Europe and Washington.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 02.05.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.05.22/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Feb 2022 16:51:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.05.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, the showdown between Ukraine and the west shows no sign of easing, instead it’s intensifying. Tonight, Moscow sent two long range nuclear capable bombers on patrol over its ally, Belarus. Also today, the first of three thousand American troops landed near the Ukraine border as US tries to deter a Russian invasion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a latest US combat forces to arrive in Europe, 18th airborne touched down in Germany, beefing up NATO firepower amid mounting concerns. Russia is preparing launching a full-scale invasion in Ukraine. US officials are yet certain whether President V.P. will pull the trigger but they are building up defenses in front line NATO’s state in response to what they called an elevated risk. NATO officials told us American F-15s were scrambled out of Estonia to intercept four Russian fighters over the Baltic Sea. Bolstering the border against an increasingly &lt;strong&gt;boisterous&lt;/strong&gt; neighbor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight, a crack in Republican party is widening, the RNC continuing to side with former President Trump. But former Vice President M.P. is finally calling out his false election claims and late last night, Trump fired back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Trump just issued another statement that hit off our boxes a little while ago, asking why is M.P. didn’t have the authority to quote “send to votes forward, are the Dems or RINOs fighting so hard to make it impossible for a VP to do so in the future?”. Forwards high ranking Republican seldom say out loud, let alone at a conservative conference in Florida. But in addressing the event of January 6th former Vice President M.P. offered a strong review to those, including Trump who claimed he could’ve refused to certify the election. The former President responded with a written statement saying “I was right and everyone knows it”. Many Republicans see support for Trump as the best way to win back control of the House in November’s midterms. A winter meeting of the RNC voted on Friday to &lt;strong&gt;censure&lt;/strong&gt; Representative L.C. and A.K. for serving on House Committee investigating January 6th, saying they are participating in a Democrats-led &lt;strong&gt;persecution&lt;/strong&gt; of ordinary citizens engage in legitimate political discourse.&lt;/p&gt;

Pence rejected Trump’s false claim about the 2020 election saying he had not right to change the outcome of our election. But first, the major winter storm that has battered most of the country this week, is now bearing down on the east coast. Nearly three hundred thousand homes and businesses remain without power tonight as the heavy snow knocked down tree limbs and power lines from Texas to Ohio. Parts of Pennsylvania, New York and New England got more than a foot of snow, while icy roads remain the biggest problem for thousands of travelers. And temperatures are dropping fast for nearly a third of the country. More than one hundred million of Americans will see temperatures in the teens or below by Saturday morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concern as the rain comes down is that it will ice over, creating slick and dangerous roads. The same system has already brought deadly conditions across half of the country with millions still in its path. Traffic grinding to a halt on interstate 10 after slick and icy roads caused two tractor trailers to jackknife near Kerrville, Texas, killing one person. Drivers were left stranded in frigid temperatures. The massive winter storm stretches from Texas to Maine. The weather is blamed for one death in Tennessee and another in Oklahoma. The National Weather Service confirmed two tornados struck Alabama Thursday, including an EF2 that killed one woman and seriously injured three others. A build-up of ice brought down tree limbs and electrical lines. Nearly three hundred thousand homes and businesses are without power tonight. As the storm moves to the Northeast, Massachusetts state police say they already responded to more than two hundred crashes. In New Hampshire, a box truck went off a snow-covered road on I-93. And in New Jersey, salt trucks were out in full force trying to prevent black eyes. The storm is also wreaking havoc on air travel. Nearly four thousand flights have been canceled in the US today on top of the five thousand yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;

The storm stretches some miles from Texas to Maine. Heavy snowfall made for sleek roads and dangerous travel conditions and the storm turned deadly with at least two deaths blamed on the weather. The roads were bad but the air wasn’t any better, for the second straight day, thousands of flights were canceled. Dallas airport was forced to shut down their runways all together. More than two hundred and fifty thousand customers are without power tonight after freezing rain and ice down trees and power lines from Texas to Ohio. Tennessee is actually hardest hit, more than a hundred and forty thousand are without power. The severe weather led to a large tornado in Alabama that killed at least one person and destroyed several homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big concern here remains the power, it is frigid. And with windchill it’s feel like it’s about nine degrees and it’s going to get colder, so it’s the race to get the light back on for as many people as possible. But there are folks here in Texas who were even if the lights come back on, they may not stay on. Tonight, Texas on ice, among the tens of thousands without power plunging temperatures, more than a hundred homes in this neighborhood outside of Dallas. With temperatures in the low twenties, the outage is frigid reminder of last year’s deadly storm that crippled the lone star state. Of this time, the outages are spotty, many caused by ice on the trees coming down on power lines, leaving a huge mess for crews working to get power back on. Power outages have left more than two hundred and seventy thousand in the dark across the South and Mid-West. More than half of those outages in Tennessee. The icy roads caused several deaths, including a driver in Dallas who was ejected from this truck and fell on the road below. Across the country, snow, sleet and ice made driving treacherous, stranded trucks line in the median of this stretch of I-74 in Central Illinois. The storm even spawned tornados in Alabama, at least one person was killed, several others seriously injured. Back in Texas, all flights in and out of Dallas airport were stopped for hours after the runway ice over. Nationwide, more than five thousand flights were canceled today alone, the most cancelations in a single day for a weather event since 2017.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 02.02.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.02.22/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Feb 2022 17:44:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.02.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We want to begin with a dangerous winter storm that is moving across the nation with a mix of heavy snow, freezing rain, ice and brutally cold temperatures. The heaviest snow totals today are expected from St. Louis to Cleveland while Central Illinois and Northern Indiana could see more than eighteen inches before it’s all over. More than one hundred and ten million Americans are under winter storm alerts in at least twenty-five states from Colorado to Maine. The storms mean travel nightmares across much of the country with airlines cancelling more than five thousand flights for today and tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The windy city living up to the billing tonight. This is a massive storm impacting a wide swath of the middle of country. And the next chapter could be equally as dangerous. Rain turning to sleet and sheets of ice. A brutal winter storm barreling across more than a dozen states. Two thousand miles of mess, snow, sleet, freezing rain and Arctic cold. Interstate near Kansas City grinding to a halt, littered with semis, turned like toys. Tonight, concern about sleet and ice in Texas almost a year after a freeze there led to one of the nation’s biggest blackouts. And here in Chicago amid sloppy roads tonight, a number of schools are already announced they will go remote or close all together tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 02.01.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.01.22/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Feb 2022 16:56:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-02.01.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We’re approaching the point in the pandemic where everyone in America who wants a Covid vaccine will be eligible to get one. Tonight, Pfizer is asking the FDA for emergency use authorization for its vaccine for children ages six months old to four years old. This comes earlier than expected. The company says it was asked to submit its data after a record number of kids got Covid last month. The American Academy of Pediatrics says more than 3.5 million children tested positive for Covid in January alone. Parents nationwide have been pushing for an expansion of shots for babies, toddlers and preschoolers, especially in the wake of the fast-moving Omicron variant that also resulted in a record number of pediatric hospitalizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer says tonight it has given the FDA data on a two-dose vaccine regimen for children ages six months through four years old. The doses are one tenth of an adult’s and would be given three weeks apart. Pfizer says it also plans to submit data on a third shot for this age group soon. Pfizer’s request for Emergency Use Authorization of its vaccine means one of the nation’s youngest age groups will be eligible for shots possibly assumed as soon as the end of this month. In December, Pfizer announced that two doses of its vaccine did not provide strong enough immune response in two to four years old prompting the company to add a third shot to the trial. Authorization would come at a pivotal moment. New pediatric cases dropped last week for the first time since early December, but remain high over one hundred thousand for twenty-five consecutive weeks. New Orleans today became the first major school district to require its students, ages five and up, be vaccinated. Parents can opt out on medical, religious or philosophical grounds. But with so many parents already hesitant to vaccinate their eligible children, experts don’t expect authorization for kids under five to significantly affect new case numbers. Only thirty-eight percent of five to seventeen years old are fully vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 01.31.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.31.22/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Feb 2022 16:04:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.31.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This could be a critical week as the threat of war looms in Ukraine. Tonight, President B is warning Russia that it will face swift and severe consequences should it attack, adding that the US and its allies are continuing to prepare for every scenario. The Cold War foes faced off today at a meeting at the UN Security Council. The US called for de-escalation of the largest mobilization of troops and weapons in Europe in decades. And CBSN just learned that Russia just delivered a written response to a US proposal aimed at lowering those tensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight, the Pentagon is seeing increasing Russian military activity all around Ukraine. In fact, that is what led to the showdown at the UN between Russia and the US. Even though President B is still pushing diplomatic solution, he is also clear eyed about the potential for war. The Russian military continues to flex its muscle around Ukraine, holding exercises on land, in the air and on the water. V.P. has denied any interest in invading. Today, President B said the US is ready either way. During a meeting of UN Security Council, Russia blamed the US for provoking escalation. Again, insisting Moscow has no plans to attack. The US ambassador to the UN, L.T.G. demanded to know why then are there more than a hundred thousand Russian troops surrounding Ukraine on three sides. US officials say there is new evidence that Russia intends to expand its presence, to more than thirty thousand troops near the Belarus border. NATO Secretary General warned that Russia may use joint training exercises with Belarus set to begin in ten days as a disguise to attack. Ukraine’s defense minister today celebrated the latest American ammunition shipment, which comes as civilian volunteers across the country. Some with no military experience are training to fight the Russians armed only with these &lt;strong&gt;stand-in&lt;/strong&gt; plywood rifles. CBSN has learned that the Pentagon is close to announcing the deployment of US troops based in Europe moving them close to the front lines with Russia. And tomorrow, Secretary of State is set to speak with Russian Foreign Minister when they will almost certainly talk about that new written response.&lt;/p&gt;

A powerful nor’easter swept from Virginia to Maine, bringing blizzard conditions to many areas and leaving a trails of power outages. Fortunately, the damage is not extreme, but Massachusetts bore the brunt of the storm’s fury. Boston is now recovering from one of the biggest snow storms in its history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relentless all-day snow storm buried Boston and most New England. Today the city emerged and began to dig out. Homes were encased in a shell of snow and ice when the sun rose in Massachusetts. Sea spray froze on the houses as hurricane-force winds lashed the East Coast. The ferocity forcing some residents to evacuate. On Cape Cod, the storm left this house hanging by a thread. And on flooded Nantucket, homes are underwater. The storm brought snow from South Carolina to Maine, including two feet in Boston. It was one of the city’s biggest single day January snowfalls on record. New York is digging out from more than twenty inches in some areas, while temperatures in the teens are creating a new danger. Three people died on New York’s long island while shoveling snow. Meanwhile here in Boston, schools will reopen tomorrow, people will return to work. So, the work continues on the roads to make sure they are clear and ready to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Covid new cases topped five hundred thousand on Saturday. That’s downed thirty-three percent over the last two weeks. New infections here in LA County have dropped nearly fifty percent. A sigh of relief this weekend as the Omicron surge starts to stabilize in cities nationwide. Covid deaths skyrocketed eighty-six percent since new year but new infections and hospitalizations are now dropping. And there’s some welcome optimism on the new variant front. Former FDA commissioner says it appears vaccine could fight the stealth variant BA.2. The nation is eager for normalcy, San Francisco will be the first city to roll back its indoor mask mandate starting Tuesday. And in Arkansas where masking isn’t required, Governor is calling for a whole new mindset.&lt;/p&gt;

The snow fell fast and winds have been fierce, causing blizzard conditions in some areas. Thousands of flights have been canceled, more than a hundred thousand are without power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The snow and wind have intensified throughout the day significantly impacting everything from visibility to just general conditions. Here in Boston, there has been more snow today, than the city gets on average the entire month of January. A potentially historic storm for Boston by the time it’s all over, with deep snow and high winds. The bomb cyclone whipped up waves Saturday morning battering coastal Massachusetts. Ranging from blustery to &lt;strong&gt;bucolic&lt;/strong&gt;, a day for dogs, skis, and a good old-fashioned group snowball fight. Plows faced whiteout conditions in some areas. And drivers are still urged to stay off the roads tonight to give them space. Well, those roads will have to be clear for the utility crews that are trying to restore power to the roughly one hundred and twenty thousand homes and businesses that are without it, and that is just here in the state of Massachusetts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another day, another Covid positive written on body bags in a Kansas City morgue as Omicron drives the daily death toll higher than last fall’s Delta wave. Hospitalizations are down nearly five percent nationwide, but almost all Americans live in a high-risk area. Healthcare workers are still on guard. And now another possible threat, a stealth new subvariant of Omicron, BA.2 has popped up in nearly half the country. Today, thousands of truckers rolled through the capital city of Ottawa to protest vaccine mandates for drivers crossing the US-Canada border. The new subvariant is called stealth, because it may be harder to detect. Scientists expected it to be very contagious. But they’re hard at work trying to figure out whether it could lead to yet another surge.&lt;/p&gt;

Tens of millions are in the path of this nor-easter that could bring record snowfall and coastal flooding. Households and businesses up and down the coast are preparing for possible power outages. At least six states have declared state’s emergencies as governors plead with residents to stay off the roads. Forecasters anticipate Boston will experience one of the biggest single day snow totals on record. Airlines have preemptively canceled thousands of flights for tomorrow. The airports most affected are in New York, Boston, Philadelphia and Washington D.C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coastal town of Scituate, Massachusetts, about thirty miles south of Boston, knows how to prepare for the worst. Laying down sandbags, and boarding up windows. Parts of Massachusetts could see up to thirty inches of snow, making it one of the top five single day snowstorms on records in the state’s history. This is the first blizzard to hit the region in nearly four years. From the Carolinas to New England, the storm system could create a travel nightmare along the Eastern seaboard. This comes three weeks after another storm caused a fifty-mile closure in Virginia, stranding hundreds of drivers on I-95 for more than twenty-four hours. Snowplows are ready to go, but many cleanup crews are operating with reduced staff, partly because of the pandemic. As the storm approaches, local hardware stores are struggling to keep must-have items on the shelves. Well, here in Scituate, Massachusetts, many residents have temporarily evacuated, and voluntarily evacuated. Meanwhile, the Department of Transportation in Massachusetts has temporarily banned tractor trailers from the state’s interstate highway system tomorrow from 6 A.M. to midnight.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 01.27.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.27.22/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Feb 2022 16:26:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.27.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;It’s history in the making as President B vows to make good on his campaign pledge to nominate the first black woman to the supreme court. If you look back of the one hundred and fifteen justices, all but seven have been white men. The President said today he will name his choice to replace Justice S.B. by the end of February. S.B. today formally handed in his letter of resignation to the President and will step down at the end of current term of summer. There is already a short list of potential candidates to fill the seat and the biggest battle in the confirmation process maybe within the Democratic party before a nominee is even announced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The President said today he plans to make his choice by the end of February. But as a former chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Vice President who once helped interview Supreme Court nominee, he’s preparing for this moment for decades. President B today flanked by retiring Supreme Court Justice S.B. says he’s already reviewing potential choices to succeed him. Celebrating S.B. today, the president &lt;strong&gt;reminisced&lt;/strong&gt; about chairing his confirmation hearing in 1994, saying he had high hopes then. S.B. says he’s stepping down optimistic about the future of what he called the American experiment. So once the president makes his pick, the Democratic-controlled Senate vowing to quickly confirm her and barring some unforeseen circumstance. Mr. B’s nominee, at lease for now, is all but assured to be confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of Houston, police captured a suspect tonight, following a citywide manhunt, after he allegedly shot three Houston officers. The officers were taken to the area hospital in stable condition. And in New York, twenty-two-year-old NYPD officer received a hero’s farewell today. A procession for the officer killed while answering a domestic disturbing call wound through the city ending at St. Patrick’s Cathedral for his wake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was a rookie in their rank, just twenty-two years old, all saluted as the casket of Officer J.R. was carried inside St. Patrick Cathedral. The wake comes after an emotional vigil last night where Officer J.R. and his partner were remembered by their brothers in blue. R was the son of Dominican immigrants and he join the NYPD in 2020, calling it the greatest police force in the world. Nationwide last year, gunshots kills sixty-one officers in the line of duty, up thirty six percent from 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

After nearly three decades on the supreme court, Justice S.B. is expected to retire. Sources tell CBSN that the eighty-three years old will stay on the bench for the rest of consequential term, deciding on major cases like abortion rights. And he will wait until the Senate confirms a successor. The Liberal Justice is under pressure from the left to step down while Democrats maintain control of the Senate and the White House so his replacement won’t change the ideological markup of the nation’s highest court. In recent years, B has found himself in the dissent on a bench that has moved more to the right with a six to three conservative majority. President B will now be given the opportunity to fulfill a campaign promise and appoint the first black female Supreme Court Justice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice S.B. let President B know last week that he plans to retire this summer. And that’s now shifting the focus to who will replace him. The court’s most senior liberal, Justice S.B., made the decision that was widely expected, giving President B his first Supreme Court nomination and the chance to fulfill a campaign promise. The top candidates are all sitting judges, the frontrunner fifty-one-year-old federal appeals court judge K.B.J, a Harvard Law School graduate who was a law clerk for Justice S.B. Nominated in 1994 by President Clinton, S.B. has been a pragmatic Justice, a defender of civil rights, and a &lt;strong&gt;staunch&lt;/strong&gt; opponent of the death penalty. &lt;strong&gt;Engaging&lt;/strong&gt; and well-liked by his colleagues, he also likes to tell and listen and not intends to retire. But that was a year before Justice R.B.Ginsburg passed away, giving President T his third Supreme Court nomination. B, an &lt;strong&gt;ardent&lt;/strong&gt; defender of keeping the court separate from politics, resisted a drumbeat of pressure from progressives last year that he stepped down so President B could replace him. This year, the decision, which the left hoped for, was his own.&lt;/p&gt;

Ukraine leaders are trying to calm citizens saying there is no signs that a Russian invasion is &lt;strong&gt;imminent&lt;/strong&gt;. But the war games on the country’s border are telling a different story. Thousands of Russian troops conducted military drills using naval ships and ballistic missiles. And while US troops wait on heightened alert here about three hundred anti-tank missiles and other American made weapons like bunker buster, arrived in Kiev today. The administration says diplomacy isn’t dead, but tensions are still mounting. The US and allies have vowed to hit Russia with sanctions like never before if Moscow invades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The White House continues to believe Russia could invade Ukraine at any time, and today went further than ever before to make clear: V.P. will face personal economic sanctions if he invades and US troops could be headed to the region sooner, rather than later. A Russian military show of force today on the country’s western border with Ukraine and no signs that V.P. plans to back down. That’s why President B, shopping today at a small business in Washington, says he may soon deploy to Eastern Europe some of the almost nine thousand US troops he’s put on heightened alert. Several thousand US troops already in Europe also could be repositioned but the growing allied response force is still no match for V.P.’s roughly one hundred thousand troops on the ground, at this point completely encircling Ukraine. The White House says an invasion is imminent and Mr. B summoned his top national security advisors for a meeting on the crisis, saying he would specifically target V.P. with economic sanctions if the Russian leader invades. The Russians reiterated today they have no plans to attack. But the administration, fearing V.P. could cut off fuel shipments that run through Ukraine in the coming weeks, is now working with oil and gas suppliers around the globe to ensure there is adequate supply. Some Republicans say they fear Mr. B is still moving too slowly against P.&lt;/p&gt;

Here in Washington DC, president B held a video call with European allies this afternoon to discuss a common response to Russian’s continued military buildup around Ukraine’s border. NATO announced that it was putting forces on standby and is reinforcing Eastern Europe with more ships and fighter jets, a move that Russia denounced. And the B administration is considering whether to send several thousand US troops and equipment to reinforce NATO. Meanwhile the state department ordered families American diplomats to leave the country and they’ve advised that nonessential American embassy personnel and private US citizens should do the same. Well tonight. Speaker N.P. and Senate majority leader C.S. want a White House briefing on the Ukraine-Russia situation for Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A major shift in the White House’s approach to the Russian standoff with Ukraine is now underway. President B met with European leaders today to discuss a diplomatic solution. Plan for new military deployment suggests much of Europe is now preparing for the possibility of a new war. President B today consulted with European allies in the Situation Room while reading thousands of US troops for a possible mission in the region. The Pentagon placed eighty-five hundred troops stationed in the US on alert, ready to deploy to NATO’s eastern flank within days if the situation &lt;strong&gt;deteriorates&lt;/strong&gt;. The administration ordered US embassy families out of Ukraine and warned Americans not to travel to Russia as V.P. sent more troops to the Belarus, a possible invasion point, and carried out military exercises in the Baltic Sea. The US is hoping its own show of force would deter Putin. Fighter Jets could be sent to NATO countries as well as warships. The USS Truman arrived in the Eastern Mediterranean today for long scheduled exercises. But NATO is also bolstering defenses with the Danish, French and Dutch sending jets and troops.&lt;/p&gt;

Now it’s appeared to be &lt;strong&gt;relenting&lt;/strong&gt;. There are now an average of seven hundred thousand new infections a day. That’s down ten percent over past week. But it’s not all good news, because the deaths are still rising, now averaging more than two thousand a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As those new infections are starting finally to plateau, the CDC is now pointing three new studies that show just how effective vaccines and boosters are at keeping people away from the hospital. Omicron is treating in parts of the country, but it remains relentless in many hospitals, straining ICUs, and push healthcare workers to the brink. Covid hospitalizations jumped thirty percent, and deaths forty-four percent in the past two weeks with the West and Midwest hit especially hard. The pace of first shot is slowing, about a third of eligible Americans still not fully vaccinated, and less than half are boosted, even as studies show third Pfizer or Moderna shot reduces the risk of hospitalization with Omicron by eighty-two percent. Starting today, visitors from Mexico and Canada entering the US by car, train or ferry must show proof of vaccination. But pushback to vaccine and masking mandates rages on. A Virginia mom is facing criminal charges after making a threat at a school board meeting. That parent apologized, and while more challenges to mandates keep making their way through the courts, the federal government is giving out the good masks, the N-95, starting next week for free. They’ll be available at pharmacies and health centers across the country.&lt;/p&gt;

The big concern tonight is ice, causing white spread power outages and states of emergency have been declared in the Carolinas and Virginia ahead of the storms. We will get the forecast in just a moment, but we want to begin with the B administration and their latest foreign policy crisis, a rising tension with Russia. Secretary of State B today describing this moment as critical, as he sat down with his Russian counterpart over the situation in Ukraine. With Putin continuing to &lt;strong&gt;amass&lt;/strong&gt; troops on the border. The US and its allies are sending more weapons to Kiev. Now the US has Harry S. Truman aircraft carrier and its strike group moved into the region to participate in NATO’s exercise. Both sides left the high-stake meeting with no break through but they agree to keep talking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the US pursuit a diplomatic solution to this crisis, it says it is not simply a regional dispute between Russia and Ukraine but instead of defending democracy, and stopping Russia from turning its neighbors into poppet states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Secretary of States said today the US is defending Ukraine’s freedom. Moscow maintained it has intention of invading Ukraine, but these missile systems are heading to Belarus for military exercises and roughly a hundred thousand Russian troops and their weaponry are already massed close to Ukraine’s border. To the north, east, and south, Russian forces are almost encircling the US’s ally. “We don’t expect a breakthrough.” Said the Russia’s foreign minister today even before the talks began. President V.P. claims Russia re-threatened by the expansion of NATO, the military alliance binding Europe and North America. The US says it’s Moscow that is the aggressor to Ukraine and it&amp;rsquo;s backing the country with training and arms.&lt;/p&gt;

From rising inflation and congressional gridlock, to a still surging pandemic and the Russia Ukraine crisis. Well, despite some early legislative wins such as passage of the bipartisan infrastructure package and record job creation, the president has recently come up short on several his biggest priorities. Last night, the president suffered his latest legislative defeat with the voting rights bill after Senate Democrats failed to make changes to the &lt;strong&gt;filibuster&lt;/strong&gt; rule. Meanwhile, members of the administration spent most of today trying to explain comments President B made about Russian towards Ukraine during yesterday’s marathon news conference. The president heads into year two with a majority of the country thinking the nation is headed to the wrong direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poll numbers like those have prompted something of a rethink here at the White House should approach year two, it could involve scaling back some of his goals and spending more times reassuring Americans about challenges like Covid, inflation and Russian aggression. President B started his second year in office today with a clarification after suggesting yesterday that he might let a small attack on Ukraine slide. On this one-year anniversary, the White House is touting unemployment rate has plummeted to 3.9%. Vaccination rate has risen to sixty-three percent. And yet the president’s huge social spending bill is stalled in the Senate. And his Voting Rights Bill defeated last night. At his press conference yesterday, Mr. B made waves when he appeared to question the integrity of the upcoming mid-term elections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::tip filibuster&lt;/p&gt;

Just today, Senate democrats are expected to fail in their latest effort to overhaul the nation’s voting laws while the president’s build back better package remain stalled. January has been especially difficult with the supreme court blocking president’s vaccine mandate and the growing tension in Ukraine border. The president addressed the growing threat from Covid and the fast-spreading Omicron variant by assuring Americans that the country will not be returning to lockdowns or the closing of schools. He encouraged states and school districts across the country to use funding to keep schools open. Addressing Russia, the president warned that quote “it will be a disaster for Russia and they will pay a stiff price if they were to invade Ukraine.”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With his massive social spending plans stalled in the Congress, and voting reform expected to fail, Mr. B argued it’s former president T’s influence that has prevented him from working more with Republicans. Polls also showed declining support for the president’s handling of pandemic, something he’s acknowledged. The administration has been heavily criticized for mixed messaging on mask wearing, announcing today they will send four hundred million N-95 masks to Americans for free starting next week. The lack of available testing has also been an issue.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 01.18.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.18.22/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jan 2022 17:30:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.18.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;It’s a tale of two Americas in the ongoing battle against the Omicron variant. Some parts of the country can see light at the end of the tunnel, while others are seeing the biggest surge in cases since the start of the pandemic. In the northeast, cases in hospitalizations are falling after hitting a peak about a week ago. And in New York City, cases have dropped forty-four percent, and hospitalizations are down nearly fifty percent in just the last seven days. While in other parts of the country, Omicron is spreading like wild fire, with more than 5.4 million new infections last week. Hospitals in Oklahoma City have a dire warning tonight, they are at the breaking point. In an extraordinary open letter, the major healthcare systems write, “soon, you or your loved one may need us for life-saving care, whether for a stroke, emergency appendectomy or trauma from a car accident, and we might not be able to help.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The B administration will announce tomorrow that it plans provide four hundred million N-95 masks for free to Americans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here in North Carolina, even as cases surged some testing sites had to shut down over the weekend due to the winter storm, and there could be more bad weather on the way this weekend. But tonight, the federal government says there is another option for the near future. Today, as long lines persist at some testing sites across the country, the federal government site to order rapid tests is live. People can order up to four tests per household which will ship within seven to twelve days. The latest effort to try to bring down the number of cases and hospitalizations. This comes as fears that Omicron which may cause less severe disease may cause more death. Modelers are predicting fifty thousand to three hundred thousand more Americans could die by mid-March. As Omicron continues its siege, some states are returning to pandemic protocols in schools. Massachusetts Public Schools today announced weekly at-home rapid tests will be available for students and staffs. Nationwide more than six thousand schools were disrupted one or more days last week. Meanwhile, Oklahoma City four major hospital systems say they’ve run out of ICU beds due this latest surge. In North Carolina, Covid related hospitalizations are at pandemic high. Currently, one in four people tested positive. In Atrium Health Carolina’s Medicals Center in Charlotte, where one hundred one sixty-five Covid patients are on life support, ninety-two percent of them unvaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 01.17.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.17.22/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jan 2022 19:21:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.17.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;While many of you are dealing with that powerful winter storm, we want to begin with new information about that horrifying hostage situation at a Texas synagogue. Tonight, the FBI is calling what happened a terror-related, anti-sematic attack. The man who held four people captive was a British national and police in UK had detained his two teenage sons because they spoke with their father on the very day of incident. Also breaking tonight, CBSN has learned that the department of homeland security is sending a memo to local law enforcement warning that faith-related communities will likely be the target of future violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sources telling CBSN the suspect was not known to the US intelligence officials but we’re learning he did take a flight from New York here to Texas. We’re also learning more about the high-stake standoff as hostages are starting to speak out for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Appearing on CBS Mornings, R.C. described the tense of the eleven-hour standoff at synagogue, and the man claimed to be homeless was taking them hostage. Sources tell CBSN, forty-four years old M.F.A was a British citizen who arrived at JFK airport about two weeks ago, making his way to Texas, he stayed in the homeless shelter and somehow obtained a gun. Today, one of the hostages says M.F.A claimed he targeted the synagogue because of its proximity to A.S. the convicted terrorist with suspected ties to Al-Qaeda. He demanded her release from a Texas prison as the FBI rescue team flew in from Quantico, Virginia. We just learned that the suspect paid cash for his flight, and he traveled alone. We also learned that federal agents are going to the homeless shelters to talk to people. They want to find out what he did while he was there, and more importantly, how he was able to get his gun.&lt;/p&gt;

Tens of thousands have lost power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President B called the hostage standoff at a Texas synagogue this weekend “an act of terror”. Mr. B said the hostage taker came to this country just a few weeks ago and bought a gun right away.
The suspect is a British citizen who came to the US about two weeks ago, landing at New York’s JFK airport. And sources are telling CBSN he was able to get inside of this synagogue by claiming he was homeless. Saturday morning worship at Congregation Beth Israel was interrupted when a man started screaming in the sanctuary. The Shabbat service was being live streamed. Armed with a gun and claiming he had bombs, FBI investigators say forty-four years old M.F.A., a British citizen took four people hostage.

&lt;p&gt;Authority is negotiating with a man who may have taken a number of people hostage at Colleyville near Dallas, Texas. Now the hostage situation begins earlier today as that service was being livestreamed over Facebook, on that livestream, the man may have claimed he was the brother of a convicted terrorist who is being held in a federal prison here in Texas. It’s believed that at least four people are being held including the rabbi. SWAT team and FBI agents are on the scene. Now before that livestream was taking down, the man can be heard speaking in kind of angry tone, we don’t know motive at this time, the FBI agents are reportedly in communication with the hostage taker. Earlier today, police have evacuated people from this scene and also from homes in this area, we are at a nearby church, there is immediate danger to the general public right now and no injuries has been reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This weekend at least seventy-five million people in several states are in the path of a massive winter storm, four governors have already declared state’s emergency anticipating heavy snow, dangerous ice conditions and freezing temperatures. It’s already been piled up in mid-west making travel treacherous.&lt;/p&gt;

The national weather service warned part of the country could see fourteen to twenty hours continuous snowfall. Areas across the Dakotas, Minnesota and Iowa are expected to get as much as ten inches before it’s over. Meanwhile states across the south have already begun preparation for this storm, North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia declaring state’s emergency. Tonight, more than a third of states are under winter storm watches or warning through Sunday afternoon. Places as far south as Atlanta which hasn’t seen snow in four years could get up to an inch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The snow has really picked up here in western Illinois, the first punch of massive winter storm. Already today, snow fell at a rate of more than an inch per hour, creating near white out conditions, turning driving hazardous. As winter storm approaching the east coast, shoppers from Georgia to Maryland were already stocking up. Up to a half foot of snow is expected to hit here before morning, and it’s storm that airlines are watching closely, they’ve already began waving fees for people who decides to change their plans and not travel this holiday weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turning to the Covid, the CDC is updating its mask guidance, it comes as surge of Omicron may be close to its peak, while hospitalizations are still hitting a record high. As Omicron continues to surge nationwide, pediatric hospitalizations are soaring more than three hundred and sixty percent. A mix of children admitted for Covid and some tested positive after being admitted. Only thirty five percent of children, aged five to seventeen are fully vaccinated. Now New Orleans is among the first districts in the nation to require proof of vaccination for eligible students as young as five years old by the beginning of February. The parents can opt their children out.&lt;/p&gt;

A mix of parrel rulings that will directly impact nearly one hundred million Americans. The court’s conservative majority says the B administration does not have the authority to impose a vaccine or test rule on private companies. But it does have the abilities to mandate Covid shots for most health workers. President B says he was disappointed by the decision to quote “Blocked commonsense requirements for large businesses”. But then keeping the rule for doctors, nurses and others who working settings that receive federal aid will save lives. The decision comes as the US facing a surge of new cases and record hospitalizations. And as we come on the air, nearly sixty-three percent of Americans are fully vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight, a blow to the B administration as Covid cases &lt;strong&gt;careen&lt;/strong&gt; out of control across the US. The supreme court blocking President’s plan to require employees at large companies to be vaccinated or test weekly for Covid. But the court is allowing the mandate for healthcare workers. This comes as the President called in military today to help overwhelmed hospitals in six states survive the surge. Today marked the highest seven-day average for hospitalization since the pandemic began. And in New Jersey hospitalizations are up more than three hundred and twenty percent, compare to this time last month. And University Hospital in Newark more than three hundred workers are out while patients continue to stream in nearly half are infected with Covid, seventeen of them are on ventilators. One out of every five hospitals has critical staff shortage nationwide. And six states reported ICU capacity of less ten percent.&lt;/p&gt;

Consumer prices were up seven percent in December, compared to a year ago. That means the cost for virtually everything is on the rise, food, gas, rent, utilities and cars. Unfortunately, economists predict it won’t be over any time soon with inflation remaining high throughout the year. But higher prices aren’t the only problems facing consumers. Bare shelves are another problem. Supply chain shortages are hitting grocery stores on even the most basic items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the sharpest rising of consumer prices in nearly forty years creating two problems for grocery shoppers, rising prices emptying their wallets and store shelves emptying too. D.S. is a military veteran and retired with fixed income and years of experience bargain hunting. He says he’s made new cutbacks to keep refrigerator full. Today’s report on inflation shows ground beef prices up thirteen percent, double digits jumps in the price of eggs, crackers and bread, breakfast cereal up six percent and the milk you pour in it up more than four percent. The White House argued today President B’s build back batter plan which is still stalled in Congress would help, but acknowledged the pain isn’t going away any time soon. Amid the Omicron wave of the pandemic, the problem isn’t just the price of items on the shelves. It’s finding and stocking them. Supply chain disruptions have starved stores of &lt;strong&gt;staples&lt;/strong&gt;, from the produce aisle to the paper products. At his grocery store in Washington D.C. R.R. says it’s never been so difficult. Food shipments have also hit a pothole. The nation’s trucks tell CBSN they’re operating with eighty thousand fewer drivers than needed. Even a shortage in packaging items from cardboard box adhesives to ink for products labels, could snarl production. A survey by the association of the nation grocery stores finds eighty percent of them are having trouble recruiting or retaining workers and that will cause disruption in the weeks ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

This afternoon, a medical helicopter was in distress, hovering low above densely populated neighborhood, and then landed in front of a church. It’s believed the chopper experienced mechanical trouble. Well, the pictures of the wreckage are unbelievable. And yet we’re learning tonight all on board survived with non-life-threatening injuries. We’re told the pilot was able to help nurse and infant get out of the helicopter after the crash. Tonight, that pilot is being held a hero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investigators will be here through the night, figuring out not just how this happen, but no one was hurt. When you see just how close the church is to the power lines, it is clear that this pilot demonstrated remarkable skill. It’s being called miraculous. Four people surviving a terrifying helicopter crash in Philadelphia. This medical transport chopper, heading from Maryland to Children’s Hospital of Philly with a two-month-old baby girl, along with medical workers and the pilot. Witnesses say the chopper was hovering low, avoiding electrical lines and this church before crashing into the ground. Not a single bystander was injured, and everyone on board the helicopter suffered only non-life-threatening injuries. About thirty firefighters responded to the crash expecting much worse. Officials say the chopper had about an hour’s worth fuel left and crews took steps to prevent it from leaking into the water supply. There was rush to help by bystanders here, one witness telling CBSN her rideshare driver pulled over, got out to help, and was handed the two-month-old, as people tried to extract the pilot. That child was driven to Children’ Hospital which was its original destination.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 01.10.22</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.10.22/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jan 2022 16:30:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-01.10.22/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We’re going to begin tonight with the latest deadliest apartment fire in the Bronx that killed seventeen including eight children. Investigators are looking into whether a self-closing door malfunctioned and allowed smoke to spread through the New York City high rise, turning the stairwells into death trap. Now the cause of the fire is being blamed on an electric space heater. Meanwhile more than a dozen others remain hospitalized, including several in critical condition. And New York City mayor warned today that the death toll could rise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have just learned that federal regulators have opened an investigation into whether the space heater that sparked this fire was defective. Firefighters have described battling thick smoke to save people inside, even as their oxygen tanks began to empty. The fire started in a bedroom of a third-floor duplex apartment after a space heater malfunctioned. Investigators are looking into whether the safety doors, designed to close to prevent the fire also malfunctioned or if they were &lt;strong&gt;propped&lt;/strong&gt; open, allowing smoke to spread quickly throughout the nineteen-story building. Space heaters are linked to more than twenty-five thousand house fire every year, resulting in more than three hundred deaths in the United States. Today, the FDNY issued these reminders: Keep space heaters away from bedding or curtains; Don’t use in a bathroom; Never use an extension cord. Seventeen people lost their lives in this tragedy. It comes less than a week after an apartment fire Philadelphia claimed the lives of twelve people. And Mayor called this a global tragedy because many of the victims are immigrants from Gambia and West Africa. Now an online fundraiser to help those impacted has already raised half million dollars in just one day.&lt;/p&gt;

One of the deadliest fires in decades has killed at least nineteen people including nine children. Dozens of others have been injured. The massive fire broke out just before noon. It began in a third-floor apartment of a nineteen-story building in Bronx. Investigators believed the cause was a space heater. At least two hundred firefighters responded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scenes described to us paint a terrifying picture for the hundreds of people living in this apartment complex. One woman we spoke to says the smoke was so thick, she couldn’t see the steps in front of her. And neighbors say they felt helpless as they watched the tragedy unfold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firefighters say they arrived just three minutes after the call went out. New York Fire Commissioner D.N. says the door to that apartment was left open allowing smoke to pour out and filling the rest of the building. The victims were rushed to nearby hospitals. Now this may be the deadliest fire since 1990. That’s when an &lt;strong&gt;arsonist&lt;/strong&gt; set fire to the Happy Land Social Club in the Bronx, eighty-seven people were killed in that blaze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest Covid surge is setting new records, straining hospitals, and more uncertainty. Right now, the US is averaging about seven hundred thousand cases per day. That’s double from the previous peak a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;

The number of Americans currently hospitalized with the virus has reached highest level in a year, with providers reporting record surges in cases, new cases are averaging a staggering six hundred forty-eight thousand each day, that’s a two hundred twenty-eight increase from two weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Omicron is placing a huge burden on the nation’s healthcare system, here in California, at least six hundred people are being admitted in the hospitals every day. And it shows no signs of slowing down. Some hospitals are turning away ambulances and running low in ICU beds as they confront breaking point, many filled with unvaccinated including young children. With Omicron cases soaring nationwide, so is the stampede for Covid test. Here in New York, more than eleven thousand people remained hospitalized and the demand for testing is still strong. The state has just hit a new daily record of more than ninety thousand cases, leading many New Yorkers anxious. Governor also announced the state is requiring healthcare workers to get boosted, with no testing option. Los Angeles just hit a pandemic record new Covid daily cases. And now California is joining twenty-three other states activating national guards to help. Many hospitals across the nation are canceling surgeries that are not emergency. Starting today New York hospitals, forty in total, are now having to push non-essential procedures for at least two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

The case garnered national attention after video surfaced of the chasing and shooting twenty-five years old black man in a Georgia residential neighborhood nearly two years ago. The father and son, G and T McMichael, were sentenced to life without the possibility of parole. Their neighbor, W.B. who filmed the pursuit, received life with possibility of parole. Brian will first have to serve at least thirty years in prison before he’s eligible. Well, during the sentencing hearing, A.A.’s sister recalled her brother’s humor, describing him as a positive thinker with a big personality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside the courthouse, several dozen people are listening by speaker cheered when the judge announced the sentence. Nearly two years after A.A was killed, his family sees justice in a case that almost never came to trial. Three life sentences, two without chance of parole. In a relieved Georgia community, A.A.’s family still churns. Defense lawyers argued that life without parole was unjust and planned to appeal. These same three defendants have more legal worries next month. Their federal trial begins on hate crime charges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Northeast first significant snow fall of the year caused chaos across the region shuttering schools and stranding air. The New York City area got more than nice inches of snow and Boston schools were forced to close after getting nearly a foot. Meanwhile, snow turning to rain across the Pacific Northwest causing flooding across several communities in Lewis County, Washington.&lt;/p&gt;

Michigan Democratic Secretary of State J.B. worries the chaotic election will happen again. Two third of Republicans believe the 2020 election was &lt;strong&gt;fraudulent&lt;/strong&gt;. And CBS News has found at least 31 people who rallied in Washington on Jan.6th are running for state or federal office. Six of them are here in Michigan, including J.R., who has been endorsed by Donald Trump. But no court in the country found evidence of widespread election fraud. Still, Republicans in Michigan are using a &lt;strong&gt;quirk&lt;/strong&gt; in the state’s constitution to change election laws without governor’s signature. J.R. runs the Michigan group, Secure My Vote, which critics say is working to make it harder to vote by proposing new voter ID requirements and preventing officials from sending unsolicited absentee ballot applications. Secretary of State B called that misguided and unnecessary. Also here in Michigan, Republicans have been replacing some local GOP election officials who certified the 2020 results, sparking fears among Democrats and nonpartisan election experts about how ballot counts go ahead and close elections later this year and in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

A key CDC advisory panel is recommending Covid-19 boosters for younger teens. That means nearly five million kids could be eligible for a third dose Pfizer shot as early as tomorrow. But for many parents that booster couldn’t come soon enough as the Omicron’s surge is shattering records across the US. Cases are up in nearly every state. And the CDC said the seven-day average of daily cases is up ninety-eight percent from the previous week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across the country, demanding for testing remains high. And here in Miami-Dade county, it now has the second highest rate of new infections in the nation, as the virus continues to disrupt lives. The upcoming Grammy Awards are now postponed indefinitely, after organizers said there were too many risks. The awards were scheduled to air in CBS at the end of this month. There’s news out of the CDC today. Children ages twelve to fifteen could be eligible as soon as tomorrow to receive a booster of the Pfizer vaccine if it’s been five months after their second dose. The agency’s advisors cited rising infections in teens and young adults and a troubling increase in pediatric hospitalizations for the recommendation. And as Omicron continues its record-setting pace, a new CDC forecast says cases and hospitalizations will likely increase in the coming weeks. With DC, New Jersey, Florida, Georgia, New York and Maryland seeing in the highest rates. New hospitalizations admissions in Miami-Dade County are up five hundred and fifty percent in just two weeks. And we’re also learning tonight that the data on vaccinating children six months to four years old could be released as soon as the end of March.&lt;/p&gt;

With the US shattering its single-day record of new cases. And the big concern tonight is pediatric hospitalization and childhood infections that are also setting pandemic records. The fast-spreading Omicron variant is being blamed for all of it. The cases doubling every few days, and there is breaking news out of the CDC after facing criticism from top health officials about its guidance for those isolating with Covid. There’s new update on what you should do after testing positive. And we’re seeing long lines of people at testing sites, hospitals and their staffs pushed to the break. One in Fort Lauderdale, Florida was forced to close its maternity ward because of Covid related staffing shortages. It’s not just health care, museums and stores are impacted. Macy’s today announcing it will cut store hours for the rest of the month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC originally said you should isolate for five days if you test positive. But tonight, they have updated their guidance, they are saying after isolating for five days, if you still have symptoms, you should get a Covid test, but it’s not required. That’s if you can find a Covid test. The positivity rate in Texas is more than thirty-three percent. Omicron is &lt;strong&gt;omnipresent&lt;/strong&gt;. The CDC announcing today that it now makes up ninety-five percent of all cases nationwide. As new Covid cases topped one million, Covid hospitalizations reached more than a hundred thousand nationwide, numbers on &lt;strong&gt;par&lt;/strong&gt; with last summer’s Delta surge. And now Covid cases in kids are higher than at any point in the pandemic. Only thirty-three percent of kids from five to seventeen are fully vaccinated. More than three hundred and twenty-five thousand pediatric cases were reported for the week ending December 30th, and hospitalizations are at the highest they’ve ever been. Six hundred and seventy-two a day, one hundred and fourteen percent increase from last week, all as kids head back to school. The number of patients isn’t the only concern, the surging number of cases means healthcare workers are also getting infected and can’t report to work. With the holiday weekend over, people from California to Texas to New York are waiting in long lines to take a rapid or PCR test, if they’re available. Because of surging cases, more than two hundred and fifteen school districts across the country switched over to remote learning. In Chicago, there might not be any classes tomorrow if the teacher’s union votes tonight to refuse to go to work in person, that’s the nation’s third largest school district.&lt;/p&gt;

A fast-moving storm system dropped ten inches of snow in nation’s Capital forcing planes to be grounded at two DC area airports. The total number of flights cancelations since Christmas Eve topped fifteen thousand, and airlines are warning it’s not over yet. There may be another storm coming later this week. While the weather is piling on an already stressed industry dealing with pandemic staff shortages, some airlines are now offering double and even triple pay for staff who are willing to pick up additional flights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This winter storm has been consequential. It dumped the highest amount of snow in this part of the country in more than three years. It grounded aircrafts across the country, and for many it made the first Monday of the new year far from painless. And for too many folks, the pain is far from over. This winter storm started the year with a vengeance. Snow falling as far south as Florida. As much as ten inches blanketed much of the mid-Atlantic, cutting power to more than four hundred twenty thousand Virginia customers after putting pressure on tree &lt;strong&gt;limbs&lt;/strong&gt; over power lines. The state police there reporting almost five hundred sixty crashes in road incidents throughout the day. While business in the nation’s Capital came to a standstill. The storm was powerful enough to almost ground the Commander-in-Chief. Air Force One landing at Joint Base Andrews in wind-whipped snow, forcing president to return from his Delaware vacation via motorcade. Unelected fliers had fewer options.&lt;/p&gt;

More than twenty-four hundred flights have been canceled today alone, that’s according to FlightAware, a website that tracks air travel. On the ground it’s not much better with severe weather adding to the travel &lt;strong&gt;woes&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Omicron and storms are making it a struggle for millions of Americans to get homes. Drivers are delayed and fliers are frustrated on this record travel day. The rush to return home is turning into a day of disruptions. Americans are facing full freeways and jam-packed airports with that weather and Omicron fueled staff shortages giving travelers a holiday headache. Holiday air travel is up a hundred and eighty-four percent from 2020. This is flight delays and cancellations piled up across the country. At Chicago’s Midway International Airport, winter weather forced more than half of flights to be scrapped. J.S. of AAA says holiday road is also near pre-pandemic level. From 2020 it jumped about twenty-eight percent, even as packed roads and dangerous wet and icy conditions slow many down. Those record-breaking travel numbers are stressing many Americans trying to get home. And experts say pandemic fatigue is one reason why so many people are hitting the road, Omicron could change those numbers in the coming days and weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A federal judge ruled that President B cannot require teachers in federal Head Start early education program to be vaccinated against Covid. The ruling is considered as a victory for the twenty-four states that sued the B administration. Meanwhile the surge in the Omicron variant of the coronavirus shows no signs of slowing down.&lt;/p&gt;

A scaled down Times Square crowd rang in the new year, as the most of United States faces explosive growth of daily new coronavirus cases. New infections are averaging nearly four hundred thousand a day, up a staggering two hundred percent over the last two weeks, yet hospitalizations are growing at a much slower rate than cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York just hit a record, eighty-five thousand daily new cases. The Omicron variant is also partially to blame for the state’s highest hospitalization total since February. Florida reported fifty-six thousand new Covid cases, shattering its single day record. From the fireworks and revelers in Las Vegas, to the scaled-back celebration in Times Square, the brand-new year has begun with the same old pandemic getting even worse. At today’s Tournament of Roses Parade in Pasadena, Kaiser Permanente pulled twenty frontline workers who were supposed appear on this float to protect their health and safety. Cases in Los Angeles County have tripled in three days. More than one out of every five Covid tests is coming back positive. While some school districts have paused and will start the winter term virtually, most large school districts will bring kids back to the classroom on Monday. Parents have mixed feelings. New York’s health commissioner acknowledges pandemic fatigue amid the latest blizzard of new Covid cases. As we enter this third pandemic year, the CDC warned the Omicron fueled surge is particularly dangerous for those who are unvaccinated. They are ten times more likely become infected.&lt;/p&gt;

There is one big difference however, vaccines have made a difference and reduced risk. It’s already 2022 in some parts of the world of course and in a few hours New York will great the New Year with traditional ball drop, but a smaller crowd than originally planned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now to Colorado where wildfire has destroyed as many as one thousand homes and forced tens of thousands to evacuate. More than one hundred homes are reduced to ash.
A combination of hurricane fore winds and wildfires left a trail of devastation across of Boulder County, Colorado. Wind &lt;strong&gt;gusts&lt;/strong&gt; of more than a hundred miles per hour fueled the flame. Destroying everything in its path, including one thousand homes. Firefighters tried to battle the massive flames but it was moving too fast. Today the governor J.P. toured the area and describe the fire as a disaster in fast motion. More than thirty thousand residents were directed to evacuate. As residents make their way to the neighborhoods, all that’s left is complete devastation. The fire is believed to have started after high winds toppled power lines and transformers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US is ending the year with a record number of Covid cases. More than two and a half million in the past week, five hundred and sixty-eight thousand new infections were reported just yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;

Now the Omicron variant of that coronavirus is fueling another global wave of infection. The US has reported nearly half a million new cases in a single day. That’s the largest daily total of any country during this pandemic. Meanwhile, and importantly, hospitalizations nationwide are at the highest level since September. And today, there was big news for parents with the FDA set to authorize Pfizer booster shots for twelve to fifteen years old. And Covid cases among airline workers continues to &lt;strong&gt;snarl&lt;/strong&gt; the skies with more than one thousand flights canceled today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was another record-breaking day in New York with nearly seventy-five thousand new cases reported state wide. Hospitalizations are also rising fast here, with more than a thousand hospitals reporting across the country a critical staffing shortage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With final preps underway for the New Year’s Eve ball drop in Times Square, Covid cases keep rising to record highs. To fight the surge, incoming New York City Mayor Eric Adams said he will keep in place a first in the country vaccine mandate for private-sector workers. City services are feeling the strain. Several subway lines have suspended operations because of staffing shortages. The fire department says thirty percent of its EMS personnel is out sick, and twenty-one percent of NYPD officers are out too. In Cincinnati, the mayor declared a state of emergency, after more than two dozens of firefighters came down with Covid, with those remaining forced to work overtime. Nationwide, Covid cases are rising so fast, it’s estimated more than three Americans are testing positive every second. Fifteen states including D.C. and Puerto Rico are averaging more daily cases than ever. Florida shattered its state’s record that was set just yesterday. And as pediatric hospitalizations hit a record high for the year, the FDA is reportedly expected to authorize Pfizer boosters for twelve to fifteen years old early next week and boosters for children five to eleven with compromised immunity. J&amp;amp;J released data showing its booster is effective at reducing hospitalizations against the Omicron variant. Still, no matter their vaccination status, travelers are now being urged to avoid cruises and new guidance out today from the CDC. More than five thousand new Covid cases on cruise ships were reported in the last two weeks. Omicron surge has continued to strand those travelling by air. More than a thousand flights have been canceled today. Another tool against Covid is soon on its way. The first of the pills authorized for at-home treatment are expected to go out this week.&lt;/p&gt;

Nationwide, the number of children in hospital with Covid is up seventy-four percent in the last month. Today the World Health Organization warned that the combination of the Delta and Omicron variants could create a tsunami of new infections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Omicron cases skyrocket, more kids are falling ill. Already across the country, average number of currently hospitalized kids with confirmed or suspected Covid is up seventy-four percent in the past month. In thirteen states, the number of children hospitalized with Covid has more than doubled. Much of that jumped has taken place during the holidays. The good news is that scientists say the data so far shows Omicron is causing mild symptoms in children than the Delta variant. And New York officials say that every child between five and eleven years old recently hospitalized with Covid was not fully vaccinated. Also today, an explanation from the CDC director on why the agency’s new guidelines of a shortened isolation period following a Covid infection did not call for getting a negative test. In Times Square, preparations are still underway for New Year’s Eve and nationwide there is similar dilemma. Here in New York tonight, there’s an even greater push to protect children from Covid, the state reported nearly seventy thousand new positive tests in the past twenty-four hours, that’s a sixty-five percent jump in just one day, a new record.&lt;/p&gt;

As an example, New York City is once again the epicenter of this stage of the pandemic and it’s not alone, New Jersey, Florida, Delaware and Massachusetts also recently reported new daily records. This as the national average of new infections approaches at all time high set almost one year ago. Meanwhile, some experts are questioning the new CDC isolation guidelines. Long Covid testing lines remain throughout the country, with waiting time toping four hours in parts of Florida. The recent surge in cases has spurred another wave of postponements and cancelations. Airlines canceled more than one thousand domestic flights today, adding to the misery of air travelers still trying to return home from the holidays. And the CDC has now identified nearly ninety cruise ships where Covid outbreaks have been detected. And in the sports world, the Holiday Bowl in San Diego was canceled just hours before kickoff, become the fifth bowl game Covid casualty so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC is now saying the Omicron variant is responsible for nearly sixty percent of all Covid cases across the country as of Christmas day. The highly contagious variant is ravaging New York City. Here in Manhattan, one in fifty residents tested positive just in the past week. Tonight, New York’s Covid numbers soaring high as skyscrapers. The city has seen its Covid case average climbed to more than twenty thousand a day, a nearly eleven-fold in last month. New York is now reporting more new cases per capita than in any other states. Across the country, hospitals are starting to feel the impact. Just after Thanksgiving, Jackson Health in Miami had thirty-seven Covid patients, it now has over two hundred. In Massachusetts, new cases are skyrocketing, it’s now one of the seven states reporting record high daily affections, more cases than at any time since the start of pandemic. Testing sites overwhelmed, lines still stretched for hours. The misery continues at the nation’s airports. Today alone, more than a thousand flights canceled, over five thousand US cancelations since Christmas Eve, some it due to staff shortages fueled by the Omicron variant. And tonight, more reaction to the new CDC guidelines, which cut the suggested isolation time for those who test positive and are asymptomatic from ten days to five. But there are some pushback from the Associations of Flight Attendants, which says it could create an unsafe work environment, which will cost a much greater disruption than any staffing shortages.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 12.27.21</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.27.21/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Dec 2021 18:28:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.27.21/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with a significant announcement from the CDC on Covid protocols recommendation for isolation cut in half from ten days to five. We’ll tell you what that means for businesses including airlines, hard hit by staff shortages. President B met today with his Covid response team and briefed nation’s governors about the surge in new infections. We should point out the number of new daily cases has risen about two hundred thousand, nearing an all-time high. New York City’s vaccine mandate which requires nearly all private sector employees to be vaccinated took effect today. Meanwhile, officials continue preparation for what is being describe as a scaled-back New Year’s Eve celebration in Times Square.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here in New York, hospitalizations have surpassed five thousand for the first time since the early March. Also tonight, there are new recommendations from the CDC for people who tested positive from Covid and have no symptoms. Tonight, a dramatic shift from the CDC. With Omicron raging and workforces depleting, the agency has shortened the recommend time for isolation after getting Covid from ten days to five as long as people don’t have symptoms. The CDC says it based the decision on new research. Those who are exposed to Covid but boosted will no longer need to quarantine and those who are unvaccinated should still quarantine for five days according to the CDC. As Covid hospitalizations have been climbing, children are among those filling emergency rooms. It’s happening nationwide, US pediatric hospitalizations are now at the highest level since the pandemic September. In New York City, pediatric hospital admissions have quadrupled in two weeks. Among those patients, between the ages five to eleven, none have been vaccinated. Across the country, Omicron is setting daily caseload soaring to levels higher than last winter’s peak. New York and at least four other states, are now reporting more Covid cases than at any other point in the pandemic. Last week, new Covid cases rose more than three hundred percent in Florida compare to a week ago. And in Louisiana, Omicron has doubled hospitalizations in a week, eighty percent of those patients not fully vaccinated. As long lines persist around the country, President B said more testing is becoming available but admitted it’s still not fast enough. He urged the nation’s governors to reach out for assistance.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 12.26.21</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.26.21/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Dec 2021 23:34:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.26.21/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;For a second year in a row, Covid is causing headaches for holidays travelers across the US, new infections spreading like wildfire have sparked staffing shortages resulting in long delays and cancelations. New Covid infections exceeded two hundred thousand a day over the past two weeks, that’s up sixty-nine percent. Covid deaths are on the rise too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here at LAX, more than two hundred thousand people are expected to pass through today alone. A lot of those flyers are unhappy about delays and cancelations cutting into their vacation time. Covid cancelations hit US airports for the third straight day, with more than seven thousand flights grounded, stranding passengers on one of the busiest travel weekends of the year. Thousands eager to take flight found themselves facing cancelations delays as airlines had more sick calls and staffing shortages. Delta and United, with some most planes grounded, pointed to Omicron exposure as a cause. Major airports affected included New York’s Kennedy, Atlanta, LAX and Newark, New Jersey. But despite the cancelations, more than three million took to the skies since Christmas Eve. The cruise industry is also facing Covid disruptions, at least three cruise lines had outbreaks on board in less than a week, dozens of passengers tested positive and forced to quarantine. And more cancelations are expected on domestic and also international flights. Adding to that frustration, and the anxiety for flyers with the fast-spreading Omicron variant is the difficulty to social distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now to the surge of Omicron Covid variant, one in four hospitals with ICUs reported at least 95% capacity this week. And the Omicron spike shows no sign of slowing.&lt;/p&gt;

And the U.S. daily new cases are at the highest level since last summer, the daily average of new Covid cases is now at more than one hundred and ninety-seven thousand, that is up sixty-five percent over the last two weeks. There are more than seventy thousand people hospitalized up ten percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s another Covid Christmas, with the latest count showing more than forty-four thousand in the New York state testing positive in a single day. The latest surge has led some churches make a difficult decision at a time when many are hoping to gather. Across the country it is a second Covid Christmas which for many means another holiday of streaming services online. With Omicron fueling the latest surge, New Yorkers waited in the cold this week for free testing-kits. Even the unvaccinated were invited in masked at famous St. Patrick’s Cathedral which remained open with Covid protocol. Covid is also having a huge impact on the nation’s blood supply, the American Red Cross says that centers across the country have less than a day’s supply of blood, that’s the worst it’s been years. The organization is urging those who are healthy to donate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The worldwide surging Covid cases is &lt;strong&gt;wreaking&lt;/strong&gt; havoc on people’s travel plans this Christmas weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;United Airlines and Delta are now on their second day of cancelation in the triple digits, but the airline says it’s only a small fraction of flights that are being canceled, most will take off on ???schedule on this, one of the busiest weekends for air travel. For many travelers hoping for a smooth holiday weekend, getting home is becoming a bit of nightmare. Nearly a thousand flights are being canceled in the U.S. tonight, with airports in the Atlanta, Los Angeles and Newark, New Jersey seeing some of the most dropped flights.??? a mix some winter weather and the fast spreading of the Omicron variant leading to sick employees and shortages in airline staff. It’s a tough time for wearing Americans eager to travel again, with a nearly two hundred percent increase from last year in airline passenger’s traveling on Christmas Eve alone. Some with canceled flights will ??? the roads join in a hundred million others this holiday season. And for those whose plan??? to make a landing in time for Christmas dinner, a promise of reunion, now years ??? So many flights are being canceled, and tomorrow hundreds more are expected to be canceled as well and for those fliers who are concerned about the fast spreading Omicron variant, if they’re stuck at the airports here at the LAX, while you wait, you could get a test, vaccine or even a booster.&lt;/p&gt;

Airlines have canceled more than a thousand flights here in the U.S. and over three thousand worldwide because of employees are getting infected by the virus. In the last week, the number of average daily cases is up forty-five percent, that surge is attributed to the fast-spreading Omicron variant. There is one bit of good news, hospitalizations remain flat, hovering around sixty thousand patients, suggesting that Omicron infections had been less severe than the deadly delta strain. Despite the Covid surge, President B and the First Lady tried to bring some Christmas Eve cheer to kids at the Children National Hospital here in the nation’s capital. The first couple spoke with children and their families and answer calls to NORAD&amp;rsquo;s Santa tracking service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last-minute cancellations of flights are adding disappointment on top of concerns over surging Covid cases, most of those cancellations are coming from Delta as well as United, which scratched ten percent of its flights. And the frustrations do not end today, hundreds of more flights have already been cancelled tomorrow. For many travelers, it’s the nightmare before Christmas. United and Delta, putting the blame on Omicron infections grabbing flight crews and operation staff. Earlier this week, Delta warned a possible staff shortage as the company requested a shorten isolation times, for vaccinated workers who tested positive. Late Thursday as some hospitals encounter staffing issues, the CDC shorten the recommendation time for infected health care workers from ten days to seven, as long as they do not show symptoms and test negative. In hard hit New York, the governor announced new standards today, fully vaccinated, asymptomatic essential workers can return five days after testing positive instead of ten. New York reported nearly forty-five thousand new cases today, a fourteen percent jump from the day before, breaking records in for seventh time in just a week. In Los Angeles, daily cases have tripled in just three days, nearly ten thousand. It’s not just the Omicron’s impact, but the cumulative toll on health care workers.

Case numbers are racking up. More people are entering the hospital. Health care workers are overwhelmed. Average daily cases fueled by the highly transmissible variant have now exceeded the Delta peak in the summer. Meanwhile, Americans are shattering records at pop-up testing sites with long lines stretching up blocks from New York to Los Angeles. And if you’re looking for an at-home Covid test, it’s going to be tough. Demand is so high that more retailers including CVS and Walgreens are limiting the numbers of kits customers can buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Omicron is spreading so quickly in New York right now. Daily infections are up thirty-four percent in just one day. And nearly forty thousand cases are the highest one-day total since the pandemic started. In the last-minute scramble to get home safely for the holidays, the most popular gift, maybe the toughest to find. Hundreds of people waited today at this site in New York City for test-kits to take home. It’s not just getting a test; labs are overwhelmed and frustration is growing. This is as new Covid cases keep exploding, more than doubling in six states, and more than quadrupling in Florida, Hawaii and Washington D.C. just in the past week. According to one projection from researchers at the University of Washington, nearly three million Americans could be infected each day by the end of January. The model estimates total infections beyond the number confirmed from tests. At some of the nation top universities, fears of large Covid outbreaks are causing many to start a new year remote only, at least for a couple of weeks. There’s also some positive news, a second at-home Covid treatment was approved today. The FDA authorizing Merck’s antiviral pills for high-risks adults. The drug is less effective than Pfizer’s, but the FDA believes both will work against Omicron. CBS is also learning the iconic New Year Eve celebration in Times Square will be scale back. Only a quarter of the usual number of people will be allowed to attend, and everyone has to be vaccinated and wear a mask.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 12.22.21</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.22.21/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Dec 2021 19:28:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.22.21/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We begin tonight with a major milestone in the fight against Covid. The FDA has authorized the first antiviral pill to treat the virus, though the White House warned it would not be widely available for months. The milestone comes as the cases, hospitalizations and deaths are all rising. And now health officials are warning of a possible tsunami of new infections from the Omicron variant that could overwhelm hospitals. The variant has been found in all fifty states as well as Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico. And think about this, it’s only been twenty-two days since the first cases of Omicron was detected in the US. Covid has shut down professional sports events, Broadway shows and concert venues. Now, a major college bowl game is in jeopardy following an outbreak among the players. All this as millions of Americans crowd airports and planned Christmas gatherings, which can cause the next big surge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here in New York, average new daily Covid cases up nearly five hundred percent in just three weeks. The demand for testing is so great that City MD, a major health care provider here has temporarily closed nearly twenty locations because of staffing issues. Pfizer’s Covid pills is the first at-home treatment for Coronavirus, and it’s a promising one. It’s aimed for those at-risk and shown to be nearly ninety percent effective in preventing hospitalizations deaths if taken within five days of experiencing symptoms. But there are also snags, as two of the most common monoclonal antibody treatments that doctors have depended on, are unlikely to be effective against Omicron. Israel is now trying to get ahead of the Omicron surge by approving a fourth vaccine dose for those over 60s. But even as the B administration promises to send out five hundred million at-home testing kits, it’s not soon enough, with Walmart and Amazon limiting the amount people can buy. There were long lines today, outside libraries in the nation’s capital for take home tests. Washington D.C is also implementing proof of vaccination requirements for indoor venues like restaurants and bars. California is mandating boosters for all health care workers. This as the Omicron variant continues to rise exponentially. The dramatic increase of Omicron in just the past week is not only taking over as dominant strain, but creating a surge, engulfing the entire Northeast, Midwest and much of the Southwest. It’s also leading to more chaos, Florida’s Gator Bowl is the first major New Year’s bowl game in jeopardy, as Texas A&amp;amp;M dropped out because of a Covid outbreak. Still up in the air, New York City’s ball drop. And the first Federal Emergency Covid testing site open today in New York City. Meantime so good news from overseas. In South Africa, where the variant was first detected about a month ago, cases are now starting to drop very quickly. But it’s still too soon to tell that would happen in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;

On Monday, the CDC reported nearly two hundred and ninety thousand new Covid cases since this pandemic began. And the spike in cases has President B unveiling new plans to combat Omicron. While just days to go until our second Covid Christmas, health officials are urging those headed to family gatherings to do the following. Get tested, vaccinated and boosted, underscoring that vaccinations reduce your risk. Professional sports are also grappling with this &lt;strong&gt;resurgence&lt;/strong&gt;. The NHL announced it will pause its season and the league will reportedly keep its players out of Beijing Winter Olympics after a spike in infections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just days before Christmas, it’s a scramble against fast moving Omicron with the CDC predicting record high new infections nationwide as soon as January. Here in New York, more than one in ten tests is coming back positive for Covid. In Time Square, the crossroads of the world, long lines to get tested as the rapidly spread Omicron variant grips New York City. Ninety-two percent of cases in the area are connected to Omicron. And the city is testing more than one hundred and thirty thousand people each day, doubled the number from just three weeks ago. Today mayor of NYC announcing a reward for booster shots quote “Get your booster shot, get a hundred-dollar incentive”. And there’s a &lt;strong&gt;rampant&lt;/strong&gt; Covid testing in Chicago where the mayor said proof of vaccine requirements for restaurants, gyms and entertain venues. And tonight, the CDC reports more than one thousand children have now died from Covid since the beginning of the pandemic. Researchers shows that the risk of household transmission is nearly three times higher for Omicron than the Delta variant. One in five hospitals nationwide is expecting staffing shortage within a week. And the FDA is reportedly expected approve treatment pills from Pfizer and Merck sometime this week. The pills could be taken out the early onset symptoms and help prevent hospitalizations.&lt;/p&gt;

In just three weeks since the first case Omicron variant was confirmed, it is now the dominant strain, proving just how quickly this mutation spreads. Omicron now accounts for seventy-three percent of new infections. And that’s a nearly six-fold increase in only one week. And with Christmas just five days away, there’s concern tonight about Americans getting on airplanes, hitting the road, and spreading Coronavirus. Today, the World Health Organization urged people to cancel some of their plans. This holiday surge has rattled financial markets around the world, on Wall Street, the Dow fell more than four hundred points, its third consecutive declines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only does the CDC now say the Omicron is the dominant variant but also accounts for more than ninety percent of new cases in the New York area as well as other parts of the country. All this, as New York state breaks the record in new Covid cases for forth straight day. In New York city, where seventy-one percent of eligible residents are fully vaccinated, a race against Omicron variant. There’s a surge in demand for Covid test, and the wait could take hours. In Washington D.C, the mayor declared a state of emergency today, and new restrictions. But there is positive news today for Moderna. The company revealing a new study showing its booster provides a thirty-seven-fold increase in antibodies against Omicron compared to its two-dose regimen. And there is fresh evidence of Covid startling impact on the unvaccinated. The Massachusetts Health Department reports that those who have not receive a vaccine dose are thirty-one times more likely to test positive than those who are vaccinated with a booster. And despite reports of breakthrough cases, the CDC says, nationwide, those who are unvaccinated, are twenty times more likely to die from Covid than those who are boosted. In Texas today, officials announced the first known Covid death related to Omicron. At Houston Methodist Hospital, more than eighty percent of new symptomatic Covid cases are Omicron. It took Delta three months to reach that level, with Omicron, less than three weeks. The Director General of the World Health Organization is now urging people around the globe to consider canceling at least some holiday plans. And Americans are still traveling for the holidays, the TSA expected to screen nearly thirty million people between now and January the 3rd. Here in New York, no word yet on if the big New Year’s Eve celebration in Times Square will go on as planned.&lt;/p&gt;

The Delta variant still accounts for the most of new infections but Omicron is now in at least forty-six states plus the District of Columbia. Fueling the spread some thirty-eight percent of the Americans who still are not fully vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is on track to be the one of the busiest days at airports across the country, as concerns about Omicron intensify. As Americans prepare for holiday gatherings, already stressed hospitals are bracing for a new wave of Covid, fueled by the highly contagious Omicron variant. The new threat prompting the government to get ready to once again deploy medical surge teams. Covid cases are climbing across the country, with nighty percent of Americans in high or substantial risk areas. Driven by Delta, new cases are a hundred and twenty-five thousand per day. Hospitalizations are up fifty percent higher than last month and nearly thirteen hundred people are dying of Covid every day. In New York City, a record today for the number of new infections prompting people to rush to testing sites with waiting lines for hours. And that concern is for more than just people who are flying for the holiday, Caribbean is now reporting forty-eight positive cases on one of its ship now docked Miami.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 12.18.21</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.18.21/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Dec 2021 20:56:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.18.21/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;It’s beginning to the look a lot like Christmas at airports across the country, they are packed. Roads and highways are also filling up. And the Coronavirus is &lt;strong&gt;shape shifting&lt;/strong&gt; again into the new contagious Omicron variant, new infections are toping one hundred and twenty-five thousand daily cases. That’s up twenty percent over the last two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Omicron isn’t &lt;strong&gt;putting a dent in&lt;/strong&gt; holiday travel yet. Doctors says, for those who are fully vaccinated, it’s still safe to go their family gatherings. Holiday travel is ramping up with millions of Americans on the move, packing airports and filling roadways at pre-pandemic level. Fears of an Omicron surge, not enough to stop people from leaving home. More than 2.2 million people went through TSA security at airports across the country Friday. A jump of nearly 110% from last year. With bigger crowds, more than a third of the country not fully vaccinated, let alone boosted, and now Omicron, a growing risk for holiday travelers. Delta is still the dominant variant fueling new infections nationwide in all but five states. But health experts say the mutated Omicron is spreading fast and will soon take over Delta. Communities with low vaccination rates are especially hard hit. Adding strain to already overwhelmed healthcare systems. To help with the spread, health officials are urging people to test it and boosted, just 28% of the Americans have gotten an additional vaccine dose so far. For so many heading homes for the holidays, an extra layer of caution. And health officials are bracing for a possible triple-punch of Omicron, Delta and the flu with a possible surge of infections expected to start after the New Year.&lt;/p&gt;

In fact, that wave is expected to be so big, a former head of CDC calls a tidal wave. In more than a quarter of the country, cases are surging, and we learned today that New York saw its most new Covid infections ever in a single day. Experts blamed the dangerous Delta variant for the spike. But today, the CDC warned the highly contagious Omicron strain is expected to become the dominate strain within weeks. Long Covid testing lines are stretching around the block as Americans rush to get tested before holiday gatherings. Meanwhile the sports world is reeling tonight. The NFL moved three games this weekend due to outbreaks, and the NHL is postponing all games for two teams to at least next weekend. And there’s also breaking news out of New York tonight, the Rockettes canceled the rest of 2021 Christmas Season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three surges are happening around the country tonight. There’s a surge in the number of Omicron cases, a surge in Covid testing and a surge in holiday travelers. This all has health officials concerned. Along with the packed airports comes fears of packed hospitals, as the Omicron variant spreads at an alarming rate. The number of people traveling is approaching pre-pandemic levels with 109 million Americans expected to leave home for the holidays, 34% jumped in the last year. More than 6 million of them will be flying. Long lines are also at Covid testing sites in New York, Miami, and Rockford, Maryland where the drive-thru testing line stretched for several block. The CDC says the Omicron is expected to surpass Delta as the dominant variant in just weeks. It’s now in at least 41 states. In New York City, hospitalizations are up 64% in just two weeks. This comes as Pfizer announces it’s testing a third vaccine dose in children under five because two doses failed to give enough immunity to kids age 2 to 4. And two new CDC studies are showing the effectiveness of the so-called test to stay strategies in schools. The studies found that kids exposed to Covid can continued safely in-person learning if they are regularly tested at school. Meanwhile, there is concern over how some test will hold up against Omicron. Dr. A.F says some of the &lt;strong&gt;antigen&lt;/strong&gt; tests may not detect the variant. And one reason for concern here in New York, the state just hit 21,000 daily cases, the highest it’s been since the pandemic began. And half of them are in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::tip antigen&lt;/p&gt;

A rise in cases has states and businesses changing their plans, bringing back indoor mask mandates, canceling holiday parties, and giving the employees options to work from again. And now, professional sports seasons hang in the balance, with the NBA and the NHL postponing games. Also, a growing number of NFL players are testing positive and that has the league requiring masks regardless of vaccination status and pleading with players to get booster shots. While on average nearly 118,000 cases are being reported daily just as millions of Americans prepare to hit the road and airports for the holidays. The double threats tonight from the dangerous Delta variant and the extremely Omicron strain leads to the question, could Covid beat the Grinch that steal Christmas again?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Omicron quickly spreads, people are spending hours waiting in line for Covid tests. Here in the New York City the positive rate has doubled in the last three days, something the mayor’s top health advisor says they’ve never seen before.
Tonight, health officials are sounding the alarm. New Covid cases are up nearly 40% in two weeks, fueled by the Delta variant and Omicron spread. Dr. A.F predicts Omicron could become the dominate variant in the US soon. Today CDC advisors voted unanimously to discourage anyone 18 or older from getting J&amp;amp;J vaccine, citing evidence that it could trigger a rare blood disorder that has been linked to at least 9 deaths. And the list of companies telling employees to work from home is growing. Citibank announced today its employees in New York and New Jersey could be working from home again.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 12.15.21</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.15.21/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Dec 2021 20:09:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.15.21/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We want to begin with the most heart wrenching witness accounts we have heard since the once in a century outbreak of tornados across the America’s heartland.

Residents are trying to pick up the pieces in what could be a years-long recovery. Experts says insurance losses from the destructive tornados could reach five billion dollars across six states. The death toll now stands at eighty-eight, and we&amp;rsquo;re now learning that includes at least thirteen children. President B approved an emergency declaration for counties in Tennessee and Illinois where that Amazon warehouse collapsed, claimed six lives. The president B already declared an emergency for Kentucky and will visit the state on Wednesday to survey the damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New CDC data shows the Omicron variant increases in the US, making nearly 3 percent of new infections. A study out of South Africa today shows the variant appears to be more resistant to 2 doses of Pfizer vaccine, knocking down efficacy against hospitalization to 70%, and against infection 33%. But if authorized by the FDA, the new treatment pill could be available this month. Meanwhile, infections among children are spiking, up nearly 24% since last week, starting today, New York City will require children ages five to eleven to show prove of at least one vaccine dose. And December 27th, children 12 and up will have to show they are fully vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;

This tiny, close-knit community, where every home for as far as I can see looks just like debris. The destruction is indescribable and the loss, &lt;strong&gt;unfathomable&lt;/strong&gt;. Tens of thousands are without heat, water or electricity. And it is cold here and it is only going to get worse with temperatures expected to dip below freezing by the end of week. But for many people that we’ve met here, losing their homes is nothing compared to losing their loved ones. And today the saddest news of all, the number of children taken in this tornado outbreak. The devastation spans six states, victim ranged in age from infants to 86-year-old. The massive tornado with winds as strong as a Cat 5 hurricane, touched down in central Arkansas, and remained on the ground for more than 200 miles, as it destroyed everything in its path. President B who declared an emergency declaration for Kentucky over the weekend will travel to Mayfield and hard-hit Dawson Springs on Wednesday to survey the damage. He has promised that his administration will do whatever is needed to help those devastated by the storms. And as we heard here on the ground, that help is desperately needed. More than 1,000 homes across 18 Kentucky counties reduced to rubble.&lt;/p&gt;

The vicious centerpiece was monster supercell that carved an hours-long 250 miles path, from Eastern Arkansas to Western Kentucky. Over 100 people are feared dead, at least eighty of them are from Kentucky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Mayfield, Kentucky, crews with heavy machinery were powered up clearing piles of debris in downtown. The largest loss of life could be here at the Mayfield Consumer Products candle factory. About 110 people were on the job Friday night when the tornado obliterated the plant. 40 people were rescued, but the search for survivors continues. Cleanup of &lt;strong&gt;decimated&lt;/strong&gt; houses and businesses will be a long process after more than 30 tornados ripped through six states, from Arkansas all the way to Illinois.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 45 employees were able to make it out of this Amazon facility after the tornado ripped through the building, &lt;strong&gt;toppling&lt;/strong&gt; a 40-foot tall and 150-foot-long wall, in the process, killing six people. Now at this point this is still an active scene, first responders remain out here. They are still searching, but they say at this point, everyone appears to be accounted for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back here in Mayfield, Kentucky, candle factory worker, R.P. of Puerto Rico, struggles just to stand. He is still in so much pain after being hit with debris.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President B returned to the White House today after spending the weekend at his Delaware home. The president has said the federal aid to the tornado-devastated communities is on its way, and he plans to visit but will wait until his presence doesn’t &lt;strong&gt;hinder&lt;/strong&gt; relief effort.&lt;/p&gt;

Meteorologists haven’t made a final determination but by all accounts, the damage is a storm. The path of destruction stretches across parts of Arkansas, Mississippi, Missouri, Tennessee, Illinois and Kentucky. Dozens are feared dead and debris in some places launched seven miles high. The Bluegrass State of Kentucky is among the hardest hit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By daylight the search intensified, excavators were brought in to dig through the wreckage. To Arkansas, more destruction because of another tornado, one of the nursing homes was torn apart, at least one person died, twenty people were trapped. Storm left a more than 140 miles path of destruction, across the state of Tennessee, homes were leveled. Back here in Kentucky, searching rescue efforts continues right now, including Nuremburg County, 10 people died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s truly devastation here in the Amazon warehouse, in Edwardsville, Illinois. A tornado came through last night, causing a catastrophic damage to this warehouse, six people are now confirmed dead following the devastating tornado. Polices say they responded around 8:30, believed there were several dozen employees inside the warehouse at the time the tornado came through. This building is only about 2 years old, and it was a distribution hub for Amazon. The majority of the warehouse here to be completely destroyed. Amazon has said they are monitoring situation here at Edwardsville and heartbroken over the loss of their team members.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 12.10.21</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.10.21/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Dec 2021 17:28:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.10.21/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We’re going to begin with the staggering inflation hitting Americans right in the wallet. Prices were up 6.8% in November compare to a year ago. That’s the biggest increase in forty years. The cost of pretty much everything is surging, food, gas, electricity, housing, cars and clothes. And those who received raises this year are seeing them wiped out by skyrocketing costs. By one estimate, expenses for a typical family have shot up by about $4,000 in the past year. Now there are a few reasons why this spike, the rebound from the pandemic recession, a flood of government stimulus, ultra-low interest rates and those supply chain shortages. President B today says this is why Congress needs to pass his sweeping social spending package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the bottom line for most working Americans, with inflation this high, if you are not getting a raise of almost 7% this year, you’re losing money, because it just doesn’t go as far. The latest item on the menu, higher prices. It’s a result of surging demand from Americans with money to spend, combined with &lt;strong&gt;lingering&lt;/strong&gt; supply chain issues, ship stuck at ports, and a shortage of truck drivers to deliver goods. That’s led to the worst inflation in nearly four decades. It had pretty much been &lt;strong&gt;kept in check&lt;/strong&gt; since the last major surge in 1980s, but now, the &lt;strong&gt;wallop&lt;/strong&gt; to the wallet is especially pronounced in basic needs. Energy prices up more than 33% in the last year, and among soaring food prices, beef roast up more than 26% and chicken and seafood up nearly 11%. Fuel prices up 58%, hotel rates up 25.5%, car rental prices up 37%. And there’s another sneaky type of inflation that we’re seeing a lot more these days. It’s called drip pricing, and that’s where companies add fees and surcharges to the bill, so they can still advertise a lower price and maybe not scare away customers with sticker shock.&lt;/p&gt;

Today the FDA authorize Pfizer booster shots for 16 and 17 years old. Boosters are already encouraged for everyone eighteen and up. Public health officials are worries that the people who were vaccinated last winter and spring, now have weaken immunity especially against the new Omicron. Now that strain, discovered last month, has been found in at least twenty-four states. Most of those Omicron infections had actually been vaccinated people including some who received a booster. A more pressing concern tonight is surge in cases of the Delta variant that has hospitalization rising in more than half the country. In the hard hit northeast national guard troops are been deployed in several states to help overwhelmed hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hospital in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania is so full. Covid patients have been packed in the emergency waiting room for up to 20 hours. As cases raised in the northeast, several national guard troops are being deployed to Maine, New York and New Hampshire. Tonight, sixteen and seventeen years old can now get additional protection against Covid with the FDA authorizing Pfizer booster shots for these age group, it comes as the Covid cases across the country are the raise. Averaging one hundred and seventeen thousand over a seven days period. New cases have been increased for more than 40% and reported deaths are up 37% from last week. Though that Delta variant is driving the vast majority of US cases, Omicron is showing troubling signs, at least sixty-four cases identified, more than 75% occurred in vaccinated people and one third have received a booster. And this holiday gathering has become more frequent, the push for vaccinations grows more urgent. In the northeast, where the vaccination rates are among the highest in the nation. Cases have bloomed more than 50% in the last week. Here in Pennsylvania, Covid cases are soared 35%. In Wyoming, the medical center is coping a dramatic surge in Covid cases. Most of those patients are unvaccinated. The hospital is beyond overflow operating at about 120% capacity, with nearly a quarter in the Covid unit. An unvaccinated couple critically ill with the virus refused any Covid related treatment, both died.&lt;/p&gt;

We learned today that two hundred million Americans are now fully vaccinated against the Coronavirus. That’s roughly 60% population. And the pace of vaccinations is picking up for the both first shot and boosters. Demand for the vaccine has been high amid the new surge, and the emergence of Omicron variant. And today Pfizer said early research finds that the initial two shots of its vaccine appears to be much less effective against Omicron than previous variant. But a booster dose offers significantly more protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johnson and Johnson and Moderna tell CBSN tonight they’re testing current vaccine effectiveness against Omicron, and pursuing a booster to target the new variant in case it’s needed. As the Omicron variant spreads across the country, Pfizer announced today its booster shot offers significant protection. But only a quarter of eligible Americans have had a booster, just as Covid hospitalization jumped nearly 30% in the past month, driven by the Delta variant. Four states, Michigan, Indiana, Ohio and Pennsylvania are responsible for half of that increase. Michigan hit a record number hospitalization this week. And in South Africa, a much higher number of young children have been in the hospital with the new variant. The head of the CDC said tonight most US Omicron cases are unvaccinated people. Nearly all have mild symptoms with cough, &lt;strong&gt;congestion&lt;/strong&gt; and fatigue. Meanwhile, the chief scientific officer of Pfizer said they expect to have a vaccine for children as young as 6 months by the summer.&lt;/p&gt;

As the President B issued an extraordinary warning to President V.P. cut it out on the border of Ukraine, or face new economic punishment that the B administration goes far beyond the traditional sanctions and could cripple the Russian’s economy. Recall V.P. invaded and then annexed Ukraine’s Crimea region in 2014. Well, tonight V.P. says he has no intention of attacking Ukraine, but it’s pressing for guarantee that the Ukraine will not join Western NATO alliance. President B has been working the phones with European leaders to form a joint strategy to deescalate or inflict significant harm on Russian’s economy should V.P. again cross the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that call, President B warned V.P. that the US and its allies are willing to go much further than they have before, posing seriously economic consequences that would weaken the Russian Ruble and, crucially cut off western investment to Russia. Ukraine, a large former Soviet Republic, wants to join the US sent most of Europe in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. With a statement after today’s meeting, the Kremlin argued quote “It’s NATO that is making dangerous attempts to expand into the Ukrainian territory.”, the President B said NO. He also said the US might send more troops to Eastern Europe and any Russian aggression could spell doom for the North Stream gas pipeline, which goes from Russia to Germany, and is crucial to Russian leaders.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 12.06.21</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.06.21/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Dec 2021 20:44:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-12.06.21/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We’re going to begin with an alarming surge in new Covid infections in the US. For the first time in two months, the country is again averaging more than one hundred thousand new cases per day. More than eleven hundred Americans are dying each day from Covid, and nearly fifty thousand are being treated in the hospitals. While the Delta variant remains the dominant strain of the Coronavirus, the new Omicron is also spreading rapidly. Cases have now been detected at least eighteen states while scientist are still unsure if it’s more dangerous than previous variants. And scientists in South Africa where Omicron was first detected say the symptoms in most cases have been mild. Now the mayor of New York City today announced one of the nation’s toughest Covid vaccination mandates in the country. Forcing all private businesses to require their workers to get their shots by December 27th, that’s actually 3 weeks from now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only the toughest mandate in the country, New York is now believed to be the first city to require vaccines to all workers. And now children here, as young as five, must be vaccinated before any indoor dining or entertainment. The New York mayor today called his mandate requiring all kinds of workers be fully vaccinated, up preemptive strike against the cold weather and the new Omicron variant. The mandate will affect one hundred and eighty-four thousand businesses, but will not apply to people who work from home, and there will be no testing alternative. Early data shows that the new Omicron variant produces mild symptoms at worst. In fact, it’s believed to be the delta variant, driving a wave of cases across the US, averaging more than one hundred thousand a day, with an increase in hospitalization as well. With much about Omicron still unknown, Dr. A.F urged Americans not to get &lt;strong&gt;complacent&lt;/strong&gt;. The new variant has now been detected at least eighteen states including Louisiana, where 17 cases were discovered in Norwegian cruise line ship that is just returned to port on Sunday. Now the real concern of Omicron is re-infection, especially for anyone who is unvaccinated. Here in New York City, more than 10 percent of eligible adults have not gotten a vaccine yet.&lt;/p&gt;

Late this evening, the governor of New York announced five new cases. It has also been detected in California, Minnesota and Colorado. Since Omicron was first discovered by scientists in South Africa, it has spread to at least two dozen countries. It’s now the dominant strain in South Africa, where new infections are spiking. The B administration today launched a new campaign to get more Americans a booster shot, part of strategy to manage a surge of Delta infections that is already underway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight, we’re learning that four of those new Omicron cases are in New York City. Still President B is addressing that he does not believe shutdowns or lockdowns are necessary right now. He was frank though about the potentially dark winter ahead, which health officials warn will include a surge in cases and deaths. Quote “In my plan that I’m announcing today &lt;strong&gt;pulls no punches&lt;/strong&gt; in the fight of Covid 19” President B revealed his latest strategy to combat Covid 19, as the US confirmed eight more cases of the Omicron variant, including a Minnesota man who attended an anime convention in Manhattan just before Thanksgiving, an event drew about fifty thousand people, and a woman from Colorado who recently returned from Africa. Both patients were fully vaccinated. Tonight, &lt;strong&gt;preliminary&lt;/strong&gt; data shows Omicron is almost 2 and a half times more likely re-infect people who previously had Covid. As the new strain spread, President B announced that all international travelers including Americans and those who are fully vaccinated, will be required to get tested one day before coming to the US. And in a new effort to track cases, private insurance company will have to &lt;strong&gt;reimburse&lt;/strong&gt; people for at home Covid tests. So far, they have been expensive and in short supply. Mask mandate will be also extended on planes, trains and public transportation through mid-March. But vaccines are at the center of President’s plan. Hundreds of new family vaccination sites will open up, focusing on giving shots to children. And there’s a big push to get people boosted. 71% of adults in the US are fully vaccinated. But of those, only 21% have gotten a booster shot. Health experts say vaccinations and boosters are critical, especially now the Omicron is here. As scientists scrambled to learn more about the Omicron variant, tonight, the White House says nothing if off the table, as they think about potential new travel restrictions, that including vaccine and testing for domestic flights.&lt;/p&gt;

And CBS News has just learned that CDC is reviewing more potential cases in several states. The first was detected in San Francisco, the patient was fully vaccinated, but not boosted, and had recently traveled to South Africa. Hundreds of cases of the new variant have now been confirmed in more than 20 countries. Prompting the B administrations to prepare stricter testing requirements for all travelers entering the US, including the Americans. Today, president B said quote “This is why boosters are needed” and implored Americans to get that additional dose. 135 million Americans are considered eligible for boosters. Only about 42 million have got them so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CBS News has learned the first known US Omicron patient came through here, San Francisco International Airport. Now public officials are crediting the state’s large scale testing program for finding that case. They say testing will now be stepped up in airport. The patient was identified only as someone between 18 and 49 who landed in the US three days before Thanksgiving. Developed mild symptoms on Thanksgiving Day, and tested positive four days later. The sample was then genetically sequenced overnight of University of California San Francisco Lab. Five days after the World Health Organization declared Omicron a variant of concern, little is known. Officials are urging the public not to panic, but say it may be more contagious and better able to &lt;strong&gt;evade&lt;/strong&gt; vaccine than any other variant discovered so far. Today at the White House, Dr. A.F said it will be weeks for researchers to determine how severe and transmissible Omicron really is. But current vaccines, he says, probably offer at least some protection.&lt;/p&gt;

It happened today at Oxford high school, just north of Detroit. Three students are dead, eight people wounded including a teacher. The suspected gunman is in custody, he’s fifteen years old and we’re told that he’s not cooperating with authority at this hour, as they tried to determine the motive for the attack. Before the pandemic, the U.S. was averaging about two dozen school shootings per year. This year, there has been twenty-eight, including this latest one. President tonight is reacting saying his heart goes out to the families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first of more than a hundred 911 calls came in just before 1 P.M, an act of shooter at Oxford high school. S.W.A.T team rushed to the school where authority found eleven people shot. Within five minutes of the first call, deputies confronted the fifteen years old suspect who surrendered. Police says the shooter has multiple magazines and appears to have active alone. Students were evacuated through the snow to a nearby supermarket parking lot. The youngest killed was just fourteen years old. And tonight, the suspect is refusing to talk and ask for attorney.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The head of the Fed Reserve said today that the new variant could &lt;strong&gt;throw a wrench in&lt;/strong&gt; economic recovery, slowing hiring, and &lt;strong&gt;hampering&lt;/strong&gt; the fight against inflation. Well, that sends shockwave through Wall Street, the DOW fell more than six hundred points. That’s a loss nearly two percent.

The Omicron strain hasn’t turned up in the US, but Dr. A.F warned it’s likely already circulating here in America, and that has the B administration responding. The new Omicron variant was first discovered earlier this month in South Africa. It has since spread more than a dozen countries around the world. As a precaution, the US has joined other nations restricting travel from South Africa and other countries in that region. The president saying today there is no need right now for lockdowns or other drastic measures, which had Wall Street &lt;strong&gt;breathing a sigh of relief&lt;/strong&gt;. After the Dow had its worst day of the year on Friday, it rebounded in more than 230 points today, but Fed Chair J.P says the emergence of that new variant could negatively impact the economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight, the CDC is strengthening its recommendation that all adults who received either the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine should get their booster shot, so long as it’s been at least six months since it’s previous shot. Also tonight, the Washington Post reports that Pfizer will seek authorization so that 16 and 17-year-olds can get their boosters, and it expects that to be approved quickly. Calling Omicron, a variant of concern, the World Health Organization says it has the potential to pose a very high global risk, as it is loaded with more mutations than Delta. First identified last week in South Africa, it’s not yet cleared whether Omicron spreads more easily or causes more severe infections. Today, president B says it’s inevitable that the Omicron variant will reach the US and pledged to fight it with science and speed while appealing for calm, quote “This variant is a cause for concern, not a cause for panic.”&lt;/p&gt;

In addition to South Africa, a host of other countries are included in the US restrictions, affecting estimated 122 flights between the US and South Africa in December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, the pandemic weary world has been plunged into uncertainty following the discovery of a new variant by South African scientists, which could be more transmissible and vaccine resistant. One nation after another shuts its doors to across southern Africa. The US follows tomorrow and Israel has imposed world’s toughest restrictions today, banning all travelers for the next two weeks. But with Omicron already surging the world, public health experts say border closures don’t help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holiday crowds are filling the sidewalks, freeways and airport in LA this weekend amid growing concerns about Omicron, the new Coronavirus strain. The scientists are working to quickly understand just how dangerous and contagious this strain is. They said they haven’t found that the Omicron is vaccine resistant.&lt;/p&gt;

In addition to South Africa, Botswana reported at least four. The UK reimposes the mask mandate as Prime Minister Boris Johnson has this warning today, quote “It looks like Omicron can be spread between people who are double-vaccinated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discovery of the new variant has sent a chill across the globe, and scientists are understandably worried. Omicron has over 50 mutations, which could make it more transmissible and vaccine-resistant. And many countries have rushed to slap a travel bans against South Africa. But public experts like epidemiologist professor S.K warned that the virus is probably already in many countries. International travelers have been left stranded, as the US joined countries in Europe and Asia in closing the doors to South Africa suspending airlines and hastily introducing quarantine rules. In a strongly-worded statement, South Africa’s foreign ministry criticized the travel bans saying excellent science should be applauded not punished, and that the country was being penalized for its ability to detect variants quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York Governor K.H declared a state of emergency today, in the face of the Covid variant telling New Yorkers, it’s coming.&lt;/p&gt;

The World Health Organization at an emergency meeting today, gave the highly transmissible variant of concern as they call it a name “Omicron”. Scientists are now working around the clock to learn if it is more dangerous than the delta variant which of course, sparked a fourth wave of global cases and fatalities earlier this year. That possibility sent shock wave through Wall Street. The Dow suffered its worst day of the year, plunging more than 900 points or about 2.5%. And the S&amp;amp;P 500 and NASDAQ also dropped by more than 2%. Well, this afternoon, the US responded, joining a growing list of nations in Europe and Asia, restricting travel from South Africa and Seven other countries in that region. And tonight, Moderna and Pfizer say they can adjust their vaccines if and when needed. Johnson and Johnson, meanwhile is already testing its vaccine effectiveness against the variant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again South Africa has become ground zero for a new variant. Nearly a year ago, it discovered the Beta variant. Now it detected one that has over 30 mutations, the biggest jump in the virus’s evolution since the pandemic began. And what concerns scientists is whether the new variant, named Omicron, is more transmissible than other strains or vaccine resistance. The virus was first detected after a spike in cases near Johannesburg. Numbers are still low, but they are more than doubled in two days, and it’s mostly been found in young adults, a group with low vaccination rate. Scientists are now working around the clock, to find answers, but a &lt;strong&gt;jittery&lt;/strong&gt; is not waiting for them. International visitors are scrambling to get home as the US joins countries in Europe and Asia who’ve already closed their doors to South Africa. The world has been here before. The highly transmissible delta variant, first identified in India, in December last year, quickly spread to become the dominant strain in a matter of months, forcing more lockdowns last summer.&lt;/p&gt;

Just yesterday, the US recorded more than 111,000 new Covid cases and more than 1,600 fatalities. But now, more than 196 million Americans are fully vaccinated, including nearly 134,000 children between the ages of 5 and 11. With no lockdown in effect, more Americans are travelling this holiday weekend. Two million people passed through US airport on Thanksgiving eve alone. And here in New York City today, the streets were once again packed with crowds at the Thanksgiving Day Parade. But while Covid vaccines and boosters have helped Americans bring back their favorite holiday traditions, health officials do remind us the threat is not over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thousand of people lined the sidewalks, starting here at Macy’s at Herald Square to watch the parade. And the people we spoke with said they were happy to take the necessary precautions to celebrate safely with families and friends. It certainly looks and feels like things are back to normal this Thanksgiving. In New York City, crowds gather together to watch the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade. Last year’s parade was TV only. All across the country, families are coming together with fewer travel and Covid restrictions. More than 53 million people are driving, flying and taking trains to their Thanksgiving destinations. Airports saw the highest number of passengers since the start of the pandemic. The TSA screened more than 2.3 million travelers yesterday. Once you get to your destination, Dr. A.F recommends gathering only with people who are vaccinated, otherwise, get tested. Since tests are so widely available now, that should be something that a person should be willing to do rather than put everyone else at risk. Covid cases are on the rise in 25 states, and hospitalizations are up in 22 states.&lt;/p&gt;

Those men may now spend the rest of their lives in prison. The triggerman T.M, his gather G.M, and their neighbor R.B claimed that they suspect A.A of burglaries in their neighborhood and were attempting to make citizen’s arrest. But prosecutors argued the men have no evidence of A.A committing of any crimes and no right to pursuit him. The killing prompt GA officials to repeal state’s citizen’s arrest law. The case garnered national attention and drew civil rights leaders to B, GA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We turn now to one of the busiest travel days of the year, fifty million Americans are expected to fly, drive or take a train to their Thanksgiving destination, that is the highest number of estimated travelers since before the pandemic. Thankfully, flight cancelations and delays are low nationwide tonight thanks to ideal weather conditions, however, traveler volume is tremendously high both here on the ground and in the air, making it virtually impossible tonight to avoid the crowds. Tonight, Americans are on the move, most on driving, more than 48 million hitting the roads.

A sixth victim has died, an eight-year-old boy named J.S. Five adults were also killed, ranging in age from fifty-two to eighty-one years old. And there is some more breaking news, the number of people injured has jumped to more than sixty. D.B is now facing six counts of intentional homicide and likely facing additional charges. His bail, this time, is set to $5 million dollars. Just days before the parade, D.B made bail at $1,000 for allegedly trying to run over the mother of his child using the very same SUV that plowed into those people in W. He has a lengthy criminal history, and was also wanted in Nevada for falling to register as sex offender. D.B was convicted in 2006 of fathering a child in Nevada with a 15-year-old girl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Police insist this was an intentional act. They say the suspect was &lt;strong&gt;swerving&lt;/strong&gt; side to side, trying to hit as many people as possible, even picking up his speed. After he allegedly did that, he ditched his vehicle and ran to someone’s home and he knocked on the door. His criminal history reveals a violent past. Earlier this month, a thirty-nine-year-old allegedly ran over his child’s mother. The night of the parade, he was free on a $1,000 bail.&lt;/p&gt;

There’s a &lt;strong&gt;vigil&lt;/strong&gt; being held tonight in &lt;strong&gt;close-knit&lt;/strong&gt; Milwaukee suburb for the victims of the rampage. Families and community leaders struggling to make sense of what happened. Five people were killed and nearly fifty others injured when a man &lt;strong&gt;plowed&lt;/strong&gt; his SUV through barricades and drove along the Christmas parade route. In a few terrifying moments, the joyous event shockingly transformed into chaos. The dead range in age from 52 to 81 years old, and they include four members of Milwaukee’s dancing grannies. Many children are also among the wounded, and several are fighting for their lives tonight. We learned that the driver now facing intentional homicide charges, was out on bond after he allegedly punched the mother of his child and intentionally ran her over with the same vehicle at a gas station earlier this month. Now the community is trying to heal after horror came to this year’s holiday parade, its theme, comfort and joy. Brooks, faces five counts of first degree of intentional homicide, will make his court appearance tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oldest victim W.H was 81, J.K and T.D was 52, V.S and L.O were in their 70s. Four of them were members of the beloved local group known as the Dancing Grannies. This summer, they had told our Milwaukee affiliate CBS 58, how much the group meant to them. At least 48 people were wounded. Injuries ranged from scraped faces to serious head wounds and broken bones. Among the injured, there are at least eighteen children who were taken to the hospital. Six of them are in critical condition tonight in the ICU, including eleven years old J.T, who is seen dancing here in the parade, she is still in the ICU, according to her uncle. There were also three sets of siblings, young kids all hurt. The Christmas parade was put on hold last year due to Covid.&lt;/p&gt;

We cannot provide or confirm the names of these released, the reasons for their release, where they are from, or their current location.” The seventeen, including five children, were &lt;strong&gt;abducted&lt;/strong&gt; in October after visiting an &lt;strong&gt;orphanage&lt;/strong&gt;. The incident highlighted Haiti’s growing kidnapping problem. It has worsened amid economic and political crises following a devastating earthquake in August and the assassination of the country’s president in last July. Also breaking tonight, during a holiday parade in W, Wisconsin, a fast-moving SUV drove right through the parade. Multiple people have been injured. The red SUV has been recovered. A search for the driver is underway. W is about 20 miles outside of Milwaukee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Millions of Americans are hitting the road days ahead of Thanksgiving as health officials warn of a post-holiday surge of Covid infections. And the concern is very real, Covid has already killed more people this year than in all of 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Millions of Americans are on the move here and elsewhere across the country, and as the number of travelers jumps, so has the number of new Covid infections. Millions of Americans are bracing for long lines, full flights and packed airport in what’s expected to be the biggest travel period since the start of the pandemic. &lt;strong&gt;Pent-up&lt;/strong&gt; demand and opening borders and spurring travel. On Saturday, two million fliers went through TSA checkpoints, but worker shortages and Covid concerns are worrying travelers. Beginning tomorrow, TSA employees are required to be vaccinated.

The Illinois teenager acted in self-defense when he shot and killed two men and wounded a third in the summer of 2020 during a protest. One demonstration turned into riot in Portland, but it was peaceful in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite initial concerns of unrest, the city is moving forward after Friday’s &lt;strong&gt;acquittal&lt;/strong&gt;. Police in Portland working to declare a riot Friday night as a group of two hundred protesters broke windows and threw objects at officers. In Brooklyn, New York, hundreds made their voices heard, objecting to Wisconsin jury’s decision to acquit K.R. The jury with seven women and five men deliberated for about twenty-six hours, finding the eighteen-year-old not guilty on all five counts, for the shooting lead two men dead. Five hundred national guard troops have been stationed stand-by ahead of the verdict. K.R was facing a life sentence if he has been convicted the most serious of charges, first degree intentional homicide, but instead he now plans to pursuit a career in nursing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Housing Democrats are celebrating Friday sweeping passage of two trillion-dollar social spending bill, and it move to the Senate where the razor thin Democratic majority leaves no room for error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President B spent the day celebrating his seventy-nineth birthday quietly in Wilmington, Delaware. Meanwhile the White House is celebrating forward progress of social spending bill, but they’re holding the streamers until it gets to the Senate. But some of its measures might not survive the Senate, which will get to changes before kicking it back a final time to the House. Progressive Senator B.S says he wants to strengthen the bill in a number of ways. The White House says President B would’ve prefer his original even bigger package, but he’s focused on compromise. Now unlike the bipartisan infrastructure bill, this measure doesn’t have any Republican support, so the White House will have to find a way to get all fifty Democrats in the Senate happy or equally acceptably unhappy in order to get it to pass.&lt;/p&gt;

This trial sparked debate across the country, about gun rights and self-defense. K.R brough a semi-automatic rifle and a medical kit to protest, saying he want to protect businesses, when violence erupted over the police shooting of a Black man who was left paralyzed. K.R’s case garnered national attention dividing Americans over whether he was doing the right thing, or acting as a reckless vigilante.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five hundred national guard troops remain on standby tonight, outside of the city of K. But while there have demonstrations, so far, there’s been no signs of unrest. The teen was facing five &lt;strong&gt;felony&lt;/strong&gt; counts, including first degree intentional homicide which carries a life sentence. K.R’s attorney was asked how K.R felt, leaving a courthouse freeman. Quote” A huge sense of relief for what the jury did to him today. He wishes none of this would have ever happened.” The jury of seven women and five men deliberated for 26 hours. They believed K.R’s claims that he acted in self-defense when he killed two men and wounded a third during unrest in Kenosha last year. During eight days of testimony, prosecutors tried to portray K.R as an instigator, armed with an AR-15 styled weapon, who provoked the shootings. Outside the courthouse, friends and family members of the victims called the verdict unjust.&lt;/p&gt;

The defense rested its case today 111setting the stage for closing argument on Monday. And today, T.M, the man who shot A.A to death admitted under cross examination that the 25-year-old black man never pulled out a weapon or threaten him in any way before T.M pointed his shotgun at him. T.M and two other white man charged with murdering A.A have claimed self-defense, saying they suspected A.A a burglary and chased him down in an attempt to make a citizen’s arrest. The man has offered no evidence of A.A committing any crime. And today, T.M said A.A appeared suspicious when they pulled up him in the pickup but admitted under questioning that all A.A did was run. T.M is the only one of the three defendants to testify and today, during cross examination, the prosecution tried to poke holes in his version of the story saying what he told jury is not what he told police. T.M was back on the stand for second day of cross examination. Prosecutor L.D focused on how T.M perceived A.A as he followed and confronted the 25-year-old multiple times. L.D also questioned T.M’s version of the chase through the neighborhood that led to the fatal confrontation, getting T.M to admit that he could’ve stop following A.A after he run away from the pickup truck but did not. The prosecutor also pressed T.M on inconsistencies in his statement to police, and testimony to the jury.&lt;/p&gt;

The man say they suspected the victim of burglaries and were attempting make a citizen’s arrest. While M told the judge that he wanted to tell his side of the story and teared up as he described the moment he fired his shotgun three times at the unarmed 25-year-old, calling it a life-or-death situation. M says he fired in self defense when the victim tried to take his gun. Well, prosecutor says there’s no evidence of the victim committing crimes in the neighborhood to justify the chase and deadly encounter. The victim’s killing prompts GA lawmakers to repeal most the state’s citizen’s defense law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bit of surprise that T.M took the stand. Only time we’d really heard from him was 911 calls or body cam videos. But today he gave his version of what happened. Instead of invoking the fifth, T.M gave jury a first-person account of what he says had happened the day he shot and killed the victim. T.M broke down crying as he described the final deadly confrontation captured on cell phone video, as a fight for his life. On February 23, 2020 his father, G.M. spotted A.A from running a home under construction. T.M says he grabbed shotgun and jumped into his truck with his father. Prosecutors have argued that the G.M, T.M and W.R.B chased A.A through the neighborhood after suspecting him a burglary. T.M also talked about his law enforcement training while in Coast Guard, and mentioned how pulling a weapon on someone can them comply.

That is the most in two months. Cases are rising nearly half of the country, with the US seeing a jump of more than 30% in recent weeks. The Midwest and Northeast are among the regions seen spikes. Public health officials are growing concerns about weakening immunity from the first round of Covid vaccinations and looking to booster shots for added protections. A growing number of cities are getting ahead of federal officials and have already begun recommending boosters for all adults. And a major development tonight, Americans infected with Covid could soon treat themselves at home with an experimental pill from Pfizer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer asked the FDA today to authorize its pill, currently intended to treat unvaccinated people with Covid who are high risk. The drug is meant to be distributed at pharmacies and taken at home over five days. Pfizer says its antiviral pill will treat mild to moderate Covid in patients with increased risk of hospitalization and death, if given within three days of symptoms, it was shown to reduce severe outcomes by 89%. As cases rise in just under half the country, some states aren’t waiting federal government to expand the access to booster shot to all adults. At least seven are doing it on their own. Quote “The booster is part of what the original &lt;strong&gt;regimen&lt;/strong&gt; should be.” Current federal guidance recommends boosters only for those 65 and older or people at high risk, six months after Pfizer/Moderna vaccination. So far, just 16% percent of adults have gotten a booster. Cases are rising in more than 20 states, and pediatric cases are rising 22% compared to two weeks ago. Still, there’s some pushback against vaccine requirements, South Carolina and 11 other states, are suing to block the B administration from implementing a vaccine mandate for health care workers, calling it unlawful. Pfizer’s booster for all adults could be available as early as this weekend, making tens of millions more Americans eligible for an additional shot.&lt;/p&gt;

Mr. T has directed S.B and other allies to refuse to cooperate with investigation into that Jan.6th assault, and that resulted in S.B being hit with federal criminal charges. House member looking into the events that led up into the insurrection, hope the case against S.B will send signal to other T’s allies that refusing to cooperate could lead to jail time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;S.B was unapologetic outside of court today before being released on his own &lt;strong&gt;recognizance&lt;/strong&gt;. S.B told reporters; he is going on the offensive. S.B played to the cameras as he turned himself in and live-streamed surrender to federal law enforcement. Inside court, a more reserved S.B told the federal judge that he understood the condition of his release, including turning over his passport. The former White House strategist faces two charges of criminal contempt of Congress for failure to appear for deposition and produce documents to the House Select Committee investigating the Jan.6th attack. Both carry a fine of up to 100,000 dollars and a year in jail if convicted. The Select Committee believes S.B have specific knowledge and was in touch with the former president in the run up to the Capital riot. The panel has issued nearly three dozen subpoenas and is also threatening contempt charges against former chief of staff M.M after he skipped a deposition last week.

Mr. B will also meet with C’s president in a virtual meeting. Well today, as the Mr. B return to the W.H from Camp D, trouble is brewing in part due to rising economic discontent. When you look at the economy as a whole, some of the numbers are strong. Unemployment is down, Americans have more money in their checking account on average than they did before the pandemic and the stock market is up. The problem is so is the price almost everything else. In the interview on Sunday, the Secretary of T said Covid caused a &lt;strong&gt;seismic&lt;/strong&gt; shift in the ways of Americans spend their money leading to shortages. Quote “There is an economic cost and Americans feel it” The consumer price index, which tracks the cost of everyday items from eggs to pickup trucks, jumped 6.2% in the past year. And speaking of eggs, they’re up about 12%, so are cars and trucks. A new one will run nearly 10% more, and a used one, 26%. B.D head of the National economic councils said today that the democrat’s $2 trillion dollar B.B.B plan will help stabilize the economy, but Republicans disagree. A new poll out today shows the most of Americans support the social spending measure, as well as the $1.2 trillion transportation bill. But 70% percent say the economy is in bad shape. And only 39% approve of the way president B is handling it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quoto &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re going to see a post-holiday spike, there&amp;rsquo;s no question about that. People are exhausted right now, but we need to remain &lt;strong&gt;vigilant&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

It happened after fifteen days marathon in Scotland. But instead of celebrations, there is disappointment. Tough talk on reducing coal emission, worst greenhouse gas, have been watered down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what the &lt;strong&gt;nitty-gritty&lt;/strong&gt; of climate diplomacy looks like. That’s US climate envoy JK, with his Chinese counterpart XZH, with this conference already well into overtime, it was supposed to end yesterday, delegates today are still trying to &lt;strong&gt;trash out&lt;/strong&gt; a concluding statement they can all live with. Quote: “And we arrived at what I believe is the moment of truth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But truth has many forms here. For developing countries like India and China, which are still dependent on fossil fuels, there are objections over the &lt;strong&gt;one size fits all&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;phase out&lt;/strong&gt; of coal use that was being proposed. For delegates from island nations threatened by sea level rise, the amount of money being promised to compensate for the loss and damage that climate change is causing wasn’t secure enough, but the G offer was the best one around. I would not be able to tell them that G has made a promise secure them their future. A plea for compromise that came from some of the richer countries that will be footing the loss and damage bill drew sustain applause. Among the measures being adopted here, that countries will make pledge next year to make deeper cut in greenhouse gas they produce, that financial aid to poor countries will be doubled. In any negotiation, not everyone gets everything they want.&lt;/p&gt;

Bannon is among aides refusing speak with lawmakers, and he was indicted today on two counts of contempt of Congress. He is expected to turn himself in on Monday. Former president T’s chief of staff, M, had until today to respond to a subpoena from those same investigators. He too was a no-show, and could now face similar charges. And investigators want to know what exactly president T and his advisors were doing, and who they were communicating during and before that violent insurrection as it unfolded. That has led to an escalating legal battle between team T and House members looking for answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reaction tonight from lawmakers was swift. The select committee is saying tonight, that B’s indictment has sent a clear message to anyone trying to stonewall their investigation that no one is above the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight, former White House strategist, B, is charged with two counts of contempt of Congress for failing to comply with a subpoena from the House select committee investigating the January 6th attack on the Capital. According to the indictment, B did not produce documents and communications and did not appear for a deposition. Each count carries a maximum penalty about $1000 and 1 year in jail. B is the first individual who is charged in the January 6th probe. The committee alleged B appears to have played a multi-faceted role in the events of January 6th and have the specific knowledge about them, including this warning on his podcast, January 5th. Quote “All hell is going to break loose tomorrow. It’s not going to happen like you think it’s going to happen. It’s going to be quite extraordinarily different.” His indictment comes as former president T’s chief of staff, M, was a no-show today before the select panel. The committee now threating him with contempt too, stating “It’s unfortunate that Mr. M has chosen to join a very small group of witnesses who believe they’re above the law.”&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 11.11.21</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.11.21/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Nov 2021 23:04:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.11.21/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The concert, headlined by rapper T.S, drew about fifty thousand fans last Friday. Many were trembled and struggled to breath as the crowd surge towards the stage. T has a history of inciting fans to rage at his shows, and there are now dozens of lawsuits against T.S and concert organizer, one of them has more than a hundred plaintiffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;H police say they’re investigating themselves to understand what more could’ve been done to stop those death. It’s still unclear why it took so long to act on that escalating catastrophe. H police department dispatch record quote “There’s a lot people trembled and passed out at the front stage.” We’re hearing for the first-time police radio calls as chaos set in, quote “multiple reports of people being injured.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issues of kids and wearing masks in schools is a flashpoint again tonight, after a federal judge ordered a halt to a ban on mask mandates in Texas. After month of protests and intense school board meetings, a federal judge struck down part of a Texas executive order, banning mask mandates in school.
There are alarming new numbers tonight on kids in Covid, more than one hundred children have now tested positive for Covid every week, for the past thirteen weeks. And now there’re growing concerns about impacts of Covid on children&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 11.10.21</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.10.21/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Nov 2021 15:37:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.10.21/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Inflation, which essentially means high cost and low buying power continue to surge last month, with prices rising at the fastest pacing in more than 30 years. And it comes as companies struggle with a logjam supply chain and nation-wide labor shortages. The Labor Department’s consumer price index jumped by more than 6% in October from last year. It’s actually the fifth straight month in which inflation surged more than 5% year over year. Americans are now paying more for shelter, food, fuel and medical care, cars and trucks, and many other goods and services. Now much of this is blamed on the pandemic, and adding to the problem, car continuing to rise at a faster pace than hourly earnings. As Americans pay more pretty much everywhere, all eyes on Mr. B and what could be his presidency’s biggest economic problem. US stocks closed lower today, reacting to those concerning inflation numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President B today touted his infrastructure bill at the port of Baltimore, but acknowledge a major concern for Americans, costs are rising. The congested supply chain has helped drive prices up. The infrastructure bill includes 17 billion dollars to revitalize coastal inland and land ports. But it’s unclear how that could immediately help the massive backlog at west coast ports, where 81 container ships sat waiting to unload goods this week. Congestion has slowed deliveries and trigger worries about holiday shopping.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CBS Evening News 11.09.21</title><link>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.09.21/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Nov 2021 15:43:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://richardsong.cloud/p/cbs-evening-news-11.09.21/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;More than 25 million people have had a booster shot since the FDA authorized it for everyone who was at least 65, high risk, or who already received J&amp;amp;J shot. And study indicates a third dose could be critical, as mounting evidence shows efficacy wanes anywhere from six to eight months after full vaccination. Children remain at high risk after 5 to 11 years old became eligible for the Pfizer shot late last week. New data shows more than 100,000 children test positive for the 13th straight week. More than 350 children died from Covid since the beginning of September, bringing the total to nearly 900 child deaths since the start of the pandemic. In New York City today, these parents jumped to the chance to get the first vaccine dose for their children. Demand is outpacing supply at some schools and pediatricians’ offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investigators are combing through the concert site, examining fence aimed at crowd control, which has the crowd surge became death traps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 4.2 million people are expected to travel by air, up 80% over the dismal travel week last year. It comes as the Biden administration lifted its international travel ban. But can airport handle the crowd? As of last month, only 60% of TSA agents said they were partially vaccinated. The agency tells CBS News, it’s laser-focused on vaccinating their workforce by the November 22nd deadline. And expect lots of traffic on nation’s highway. AAA anticipates 90% travelers will jump in the car Thanksgiving weekend. That’s more than 48 million people on the road, despite the average gas price of gas costing more than $1 more per gallon since this time last year.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
