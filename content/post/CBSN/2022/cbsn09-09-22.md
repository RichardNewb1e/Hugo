Today, the commonwealth heard from its new sovereign. King Charles III addressed a grieving nation and the world for the first time as King, promising to carry up his mother’s life long service to British people. King Charles and Camila, the new Queen consort arrived at Buckingham Palace greeted by thousands of people. And at military sites across the United Kingdom, cannon fire rang out in a ninety-six-gun salute, one round for each year of the Queen’s life. The first King speech was an intensely personal message. King Charles flew back from Balmoral Castel in Scotland, making his way to Buckingham Palace. And when the King and the Queen Consort Camila got out their car. They received the kind of warm welcome that conveyed the crowds here were not just gathered to bid farewell to their beloved queen, but to greet their new King. The day ended with a solemn remembrance service at St. Paul’s Cathedral and that emotional speech that nearly brought the new King to tears.
