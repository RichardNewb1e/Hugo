It is one of the biggest shopping weekends of the year and Americans are spending and it’s 2019. With Covid fears subsiding, Black Friday shoppers turned out in force, taking advantage of the sales despite inflation in forty years high. One thing that is keeping in store crowd levels low, online shopping. More than nine million dollars was spent home on Friday. That’s a record, up more than two percent from last year. And on what is now known as Small Business Saturday, one survey found more than sixty percent of small retailers are expecting higher profits this holiday season. 

A new survey from personal finance website bankrate.com shows even more Americans shop on Saturday than Black Friday. But the majority of consumers still buy from large businesses. But the retailers say the cloud hanging over this weekend, is inflation. Now Small Business Saturday is relatively new idea. It’s only been around since 2010. But lasty year, Americans spent an estimated twenty-three billion dollars on small businesses, with more than half of that spent online. 

It's beginning to look a lot like winter, snow blanketed Western Texas again today. But what’s in store for the millions of you heading home tomorrow or Monday?
