Tonight, we come on the air with severe weather impacting millions of Americans post tropical cyclone N is unleashing torrential rains across the eastern half of the country. The storm which made landfall as a rare November hurricane costed unprecedented structural damage along Florida’s Atlantic coast. Heavy rains with possible floodings are tracking from the central Appalachian to New England tonight until Saturday. In Florida, residents are still picking up the pieces after dangerous storm surge washed away the foundations from several beach front homes causing them to collapse into the Atlantic Ocean. 

A giant hole is all that’s left where the back cap of this family’s property once stood. And families along the shore fear further collapse as erosion from hurricane N washed away	sand from beneath their homes. Tonight, residents along Florida’s east coast are wondering what comes next. Near half the property that has been with the family for about forty years simply slipped to the Sea of Atlantic. Much the sand on the beaches will need to be restored likely costing to the millions. That doesn’t include rebuilding the sea walls to better protect these properties.
