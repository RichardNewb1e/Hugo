We want to begin with what is now becoming all too common, another mass shooting in America. This time, in a quiet suburb of Raleigh, North Carolina. Police are searching for a motive in the shooting rampage that killed five people. The fifteen-year-old suspect is in critical condition in a North Carolina hospital. The victims include the suspect’s own brother, a sixteen-year-old high school student. And a twenty-nine-year-old off duty police officer. The other victims, all women, range in age from thirty-four to fifty-two. The Thursday afternoon shootings began hours long manhunt. 

The Wake County district attorney is expected to charge that fifteen-year-old suspect as an adult. C is one of five victims killed in yesterday’s shooting. Now police have not named the suspect, his motive is not known. This is the nation’s 25th mass murder this year. 

Back here in Washington, former President D.T has sent a message to the January 6 committee after unanimously voted to issue him a subpoena. Instead of answering questions or agreeing to testify, the former president used his rambling fourteen-page letter to attack the panel and its members.
