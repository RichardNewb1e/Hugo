We begin with the breaking news from the federal courthouse right here in Washington. Thirty-nine-year-old, once the top leader of the far-right extremist group the Proud Boys was just sentenced to twenty-two years in federal prison for orchestrating the failed plot to forcibly block the peaceful transfer of power following the 2020 presidential election. It’s the longest sentence yet stemming from the January 6 assault on the US Capitol but not as long as the thirty-three years requested by prosecutors. He begged the judge for mercy saying “I’m not a political zealot.” But did not receive that mercy.
