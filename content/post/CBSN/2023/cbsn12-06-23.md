We want to begin tonight with new developments in a shooting on a college campus just hours ago. We are just learning from law enforcement that multiple people were killed after a gunman opened fire inside the Business School at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Tonight, we have new reporting on the gunman and weâ€™ll hear from students who barricaded themselves inside classrooms to stay safe. The active shooter not only caused a lockdown on campus, but a temporary shutdown of the airport in Las Vegas, which is just miles from the strip.

Sirens blared through the streets of Las Vegas as officers responded to reports of an active shooter at UNLV shortly before noon. Campus police sent out alerts to students and faculty, telling them about shoots being fired in the Beam Hall building and ordering them to run, hide, fight. As the campus of more than thirty thousand remained on lockdown, those off campus used their phones to keep contact with panic loved ones. Some students were let out in formation as others reunited with families.
