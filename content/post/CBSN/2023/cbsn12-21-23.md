An intense storm is slamming the west, impacting holiday travel and we’ll get to it in a moment. But we begin in central Europe with a rare deadly mass shooting on a university campus. At least fourteen people were killed and twenty-five other wounded when a lone gunman opened fire from the roof of a building at Charles University in Prague, the Capital City of the Czech Republic. Police say they later found the body of the gunman, a twenty-four-year-old student at that school. And this happened in the heart of historic Prague. Police say there is no indication of any political or terrorism motive for today’s attack.
