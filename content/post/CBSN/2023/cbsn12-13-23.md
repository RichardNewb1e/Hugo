We want to begin tonight with the breaking news here in Washington on Capitol Hill where just a short time ago Republicans in the House voted to begin a formal impeachment inquiry into President B. This next step follows the years-long scrutiny of the president and his family that has turned up no proof of high crimes and misdemeanors. Democrats tonight are calling the move by Republicans an extreme political stunt that has no credibility and no legitimacy. Well, today’s vote comes as same day that H.B showed up on Capitol Hill, not to testify but to blast Republicans for what he said were attacks on him to embarrass and damage his father. 

It was just hours after the president’s son made that dramatic appearance outside the Capitol defending his father that House Republicans launched an effort to impeach the President. A party vote line tonight will launch another attempt to impeach US president. Republicans approved a formal impeachment inquiry alleging President B might have benefited from his son’s foreign business dealings and has stonewalled them.
