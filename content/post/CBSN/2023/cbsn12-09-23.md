It is a rough weekend across the nation with severe weather from coast to coast. This tornado terrified people northwest of Nashville, knocking down trees and powerlines. Dime-sized hail battered Arkansas, and now all that soaking rain and wind are heading northeast. While out west, they’re dealing with snow.

Strong, severe thunderstorm, heavy rain damaging winds around as we head overnight and into your Sunday as well. So heavy downpours, flash floodings observed, but everyone dealing with the gusty winds. 

Israel is widening its hunt for members of Hamas as the UN says half the population in Gaza is starving. 

Israeli’s ambassador to the United Nations is thanking President J.B after the United States issued a veto against a UN Security Council resolution calling for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.
