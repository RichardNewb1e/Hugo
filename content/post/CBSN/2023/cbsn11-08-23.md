And we begin tonight with breaking news. We’re just learning from the Pentagon about airstrikes in Eastern Syria. The target? A weapons storage facility linked to Iran and Iranian-backed groups. The Secretary of Defense revealing that the US military is responding to more than forty attacks on US Forces in Iraq and Syria. 

Tonight, at the direction of President B, two F-15 fighter jets launched airstrikes in eastern Syria at the weapons facility that is used by Iran’s Revolutionary Guard and proxy forces that are backed by Iran. They were in response to attacks on US troops both Syria and Iraq over forty in the last three weeks alone that have injured nearly fifty American service members. And just today, US troops were attacked again in Syria. And in another sign of the increased signs in the region, an American Reaper Drone costing about thirty million dollars was shot down in the Red Sea by the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels. They had fired missiles last month toward Israel which were shot down by a US Naval ship. President B has repeatedly warned Iran, a longtime adversary of Israel against getting involved in the war in the Middle East.
