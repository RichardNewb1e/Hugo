We begin with another community in mourning tonight, shattered after a mass shooting as at a sweet sixteen party. Four people were killed. Their ages range from seventeen to twenty-three. Two of them were high school seniors. Tonight, we speak to the mother of a hometown hero who had just signed to play football in college. At least thirty-two others were injured and several are in critical condition when gunfire turned a birthday party into a nightmare in the small town of Dadeville, Alabama on Sunday. Authorities say they have strong leads but have not released anything about a motive or possible suspects. And it comes as a new CBS poll shows seventy-seven percent of parents are concerned about gun violence and as guns have surpassed car accidents as the leading cause of death for children in the US. 

Police are still very tight-lipped about this investigation. But the girl who had the sweet sixteen party at this venue behind me told me that there were rumors that someone may have had a gun. Well, that prompted her mother to stop the party, turn the lights on, and tell everyone inside if you are over eighteen and you have gun, you need to leave. Later that night, the unthinkable happened.
