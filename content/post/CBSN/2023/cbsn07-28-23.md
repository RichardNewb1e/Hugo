Tonight, D.T makes his first campaign appearance since the new charges. The former president holds a dominant lead in the race for the Republican nomination. 

Former President D.T leads the Republican presidential field by as much as thirty points in some polls. His sustained popularity, despite the legal challenges, is why opponents closest him avoid directly criticizing his alleged misconduct. In an interview with CBSN, Florida Governor R.D wouldn’t do it. But today, D says he disagree with T on issues like border security and spending. Now in third place, South Carolina Senator T.S also avoids attacking T. The Senator is sneaking up in the polls and is now taking on D. over Florida’s new Black History curriculum standards. The new guideline say Florida middle schoolers should be taught about the harsh conditions enslaved people endured, and about how slaves develop skills which, in some instances, could be applied for their personal benefit.
