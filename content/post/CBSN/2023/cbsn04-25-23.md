We want to begin with some breaking news. Senior administration officials tell CBSN that the ISIS leader behind the 2021 suicide bombing at the Kabul airport has been killed. Thirteen US service members died in the attack and forty-five others were injured. At least one hundred and seventy Afghans were also killed. The White House did not release the name but describe the senior Islamic leader as the mastermind of the assault. It happened at an airport entrance known as Abbey Gate, where people were gathering, hoping to get out of Afghanistan with the help of US troops. The deadly attack occurred during the chaotic withdrawal and it is considered one of the darkest moment of Bâ€™s presidency. 

A measure of justice for the thirteen American servicemen and women killed by a suicide bomber during the chaotic evacuation of Afghanistan. The mastermind behind that attacked was killed by Taliban. It happened earlier this month in fighting between the Taliban and ISIS. The bomb carved a path of death destruction through the crowd, wounding forty-five other servicemen and women and killing at least one hundred and seventy Afghan civilians.
