There is breaking news tonight. Former President J.C has decided against any further medical treatment and entered home hospice care. Mr. C is now ninety-eight years old. His decision follows a series of hospital statements. This weekend, several family members have gathered at the C’s home in Georgia. The statement released by the C center announced Mr. C decided to spend his remaining time at home with his family.

The former president is the longest living US president in American history. He only served one term, but his time outside the building behind me that’s really defined him later decades, volunteering for habitat humanity and speaking out for social justice issues. He was diagnosed brain cancer in 2015, which he beat then he had a serious health problem in 2019, that he stopped from what he is doing his favorite things, to teach his Sunday school at church. Of course, here in Washington, President B also went to mass, and Vice President K.H is overseas attending an annual conference with diplomats and security officials. That conference was supposed to be mainly focused on Russia and Ukraine, but its high profile meeting on the sideline between the US and China that’s threatening to pofocus.
