We begin with breaking news on Hurricane Lee and its potential impacts on most of the east coast this weekend. Lee rapidly intensified from a category two doubling winds in twenty-four hours, and then briefly becoming the first category five hurricane of the season. Weather experts are watching this closely. They are concerned the storms like Lee that gain strength so quickly are happening more frequently. Heavy waves and hazardous ??? conditions are expected to impact much of the east coast beginning Sunday and Monday even while the storm is hundreds of miles out in Atlantic. Also tonight, we are tracking heavy thunderstorms that are rumbling across the northeast. In New Jersey, roads are flooded and trees are knocked down.
