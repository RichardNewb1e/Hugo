Communities in the south have been flooded by a series of tornadoes that tore through several states Friday leaving behind an almost apocalyptic path of destruction. More than two dozen people were killed in Mississippi, at least one in Alabama and the search for the missing is underway. President B pledged the government will do everything they can to help. 

The tornado hit at night when the sun came up thatâ€™s when many residents realized their house tore down. This is some of the damages starting to see. The walls are gone, the roof is gone up on the home. Residents have been all days trying to pick up the pieces. The view above Silver City, Mississippi shows devastation all around. Homes flatten, cars destroyed and trees split apart. Houses were pummeled and roofs were ripped off. The National Weather Service says the tornado cut a path over one hundred miles long. And there is widespread structural damage in the city of Emery, including the water department, leaving residents under an emergency boil water notice. The county officials told us eighty-five percent of the homes here are damaged and it will take weeks to clean up. The Governor of Mississippi has issued a disaster declaration.
