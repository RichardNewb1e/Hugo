Tonight, the holiday travel rush is in full swing with more than forty-two million Americans looking to get away for the long Memorial Day weekend. That’s a 7% last year. Now, a majority of you will be driving to your destinations hitting the road and traffic-jammed highways to celebrate the unofficial start of summer. Air travel will also be one of the busiest in years, with a post-pandemic record of nearly 3.4 million passengers. And nearly 2 million Americans are taking trains, buses or cruise this year. That’s up more than twenty percent from 2022. Much of will see warm temperatures and sunny skies. However, those in the Southeast should brace for heavy rain. 

I started my day in Chicago this morning flying to Phoenix just a couple of hours ago. And you really get a sense for why the TSA was bracing for today to be one of the busiest days since the start of the pandemic. The airlines say Memorial Day weekend so far has been mostly smooth-sailing. The great summer getaway is on. The vast majority will be hitting the roads. AAA expects more than thirty-seven million Americans to drive.
