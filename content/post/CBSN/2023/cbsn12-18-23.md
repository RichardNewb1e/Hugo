We want to begin with that dangerous weather that is sweeping the large parts of the country. Hundreds of thousands of Americans from New York to Massachusetts and Maine are without power tonight after that massive storm battered the northeast with those torrential rains and wind gusts up to ninety miles per hour. Two people were killed by falling trees in New England. In Michigan, this intense system causes massive pileup on Interstate 94 near Kalamazoo. Near whiteout conditions and blinding snow caused multiple crashes, leaving cars and people stranded. So, from the road to the sky, major disruptions at US airports. Today, more than four thousand flights delayed and more than five canceled. 

Well, this storm has many holiday travelers struggling to get their destinations and we learn today about the record fine that Southwest is paying for last yearâ€™s holiday travel meltdown.
