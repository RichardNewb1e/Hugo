There is breaking news from Memphis. Today, the city’s Police Department it would shut down the crime fighting unit that included officers charged in the death of T.N. The so-called Scorpion Unit had a reputation of using aggressive tactics. Those officers now fired, face second degree murder and other charges in the death of twenty-nine-year-old following his violent arrest earlier this month. Today, people in Memphis turned out to demonstrate after videos were released, showing N anguish as officers hit him with a baton and repeatedly punched, kicked and pepper sprayed him. In a tweet today, former President B.O those actions as quote “vicious and unjustified and a painful remainder how far America still has to go in fixing how we police our streets”. 

There are still a few protests here but the weather has largely stopped people from coming out despite the outpouring of grief following release of the videos. The release of the videos brought hundreds of Memphis protesters out to the streets Friday night. Many marched on I-55 and for hours blocked the bridge connecting Memphis to Arkansas. Protesters were out again today.
