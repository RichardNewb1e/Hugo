We begin tonight in central Tennessee where powerful storms killed at least six people and unleashed a trail of terror in the state. Tonight, crews are still digging out from the rubble after an outbreak of tornadoes flipped trucks, flatten homes and toppled powerlines. Tens of thousands of people are still without power right now. 

In this neighborhood, powerlines and poles were toppled and homes are now missing entire sections. Itâ€™s also in this area where three people were killed including a child. There was little doubt as the intense storm flew through middle Tennessee that these incredibly large funnel clouds near the heart of Nashville would cause major damage. This is the rubble left in its wake, devastating, deadly, and widespread. The damage is heaviest in Clarksville and in Hendersonville where little is left of this antique mart. Tonight, those here to salvaging what they can, cleaning up and taking stock. Crews have been deployed to these hard hit neighborhoods to try to restore power, but at last check, more than twenty thousand customers were still without electricity and temperatures are expected to dip below freezing overnight.
