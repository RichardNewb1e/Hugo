Extreme weather has struck all over the country this summer. And this weekend is no different, with millions enduring scorching temperatures, and in some places brutal humidity. But the worst maybe yet to come. The National Weather Service says parts of the West and Southwest are experiencing a heatwave that could near or top records for both intensity and longevity. 

Many people here in California are outside enjoying this break in the weather, as another stifling heat wave is just days away. Meanwhile, millions of others suffering in triple digit temperatures with no end in sight. In Phoenix, there hasnâ€™t been a day cooler than one hundred and ten degrees this month, with excessive heat warnings expected to last through at least next week. Adding to the danger, red flag warnings as the Southwest braces for what could be yet another grueling record-breaking heat wave. M.M and other scientists warn climate change could also trigger more devastating wildfires like the ones in Canada that exposed millions to dangerous air. To prevent even more extreme weather events. Professor M warns actions is needed now. Now experts say everyone could help cool the planet by just using less gas, energy and water.
