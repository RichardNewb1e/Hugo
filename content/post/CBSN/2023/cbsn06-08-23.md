We begin tonight’s CBS Evening News with breaking news. Former President D.T has been indicted on charges of mishandling classified documents at his Florida estate. For the first time in American history, a former president is facing federal charges. D.T posting on social media just tonight, that he is expected to surrender to authorities in Miami on Tuesday at 3:00 PM. Mr. T calling this a dark day for America. CBSN has learned that there are seven counts. These charges are related to the national defense information. Now, the indictment filed by the office of the Special Counsel J.S comes as there has been a wide-ranging investigation into the handling of top-secret documents and Mr. T’s efforts to retain power after his 2020 election loss. And make no mistake, this creates extraordinary situation as this places the US Justice Department in charge of an investigation of not only the former president but also the current Republican front runner for the 2024 presidential race. This is going to be messy politically. D.T already holds the historic place of being the only president to be twice impeached and now he is the first to be indicted on federal charges.
