Today, in outpouring of tributes for former President J.C after it was announced that he would be receiving hospice care at home. At age ninety-eight years old, Mr. C is the nation’s oldest living president. His decision follows a series of hospital says in many years of health. Today, President B and First Lady J.B said they admire Mr. C for his strength and humility adding that they hope he continue his journey with grace and dignity.

Since President C’s decision was made public, people here in this town, so intertwined with his life have been reflecting on his legacy and praying. This morning, churchgoers quietly congregated at Maranatha Baptist in Plains where former President J.C has long taught Sunday school.

On Saturday, J.C, the president’s grandson wrote on Twitter that his grandfather and grandmother, former First Lady R.C are at peace and as always, their home is full of love.
