We begin tonight with new tensions between the worldâ€™s largest military superpowers: The United States and China. At issue, the latest military moves here in the Strait of Taiwan between the island and China. New video shows a Chinese warship speeding up coming with a hundred and fifty yards of hitting the American missile destroyer, the USS Chung-Hoon. The Chinese ship even called the American vessel ordering it to move or there would be a collision. The US ship slowed to avoid a crash. News of the incident coming the same day US Defense Secretary L.A in Singapore issued this warning to Beijing. Eight days ago, a Chinese fighter jet in the same region flew so close to a US military plane, it created turbulence. China sees the US military presence in the South China Sea and Taiwan Strait as a violation of its sovereignty. Today is a day of mourning in India after its worst train disaster in decades. A passenger train derailed, crashing into two other trains and killing more than two hundred and eighty eight people.
