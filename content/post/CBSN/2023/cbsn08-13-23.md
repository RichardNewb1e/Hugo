The death toll from the historic fire that roared through parts of the Hawaiian Island of Maui has risen again. More than ninety people confirmed killed. The inferno is now the deadliest US wildfire in more than a century. The scale of suffering and trauma only now coming into focus. 

We are just back now from a shelter still filled with a thousand people five days after that wildfire chewed through parts of west Maui. And many people here tell us they are still trying to comprehend the sheer scale of the devastation and to process the pain. The people in Hawaii are some of the toughest around, but even they need help, they certainly do. There is a search for everyday things like gasoline, phone reception, just a signal, or your next hot meal. Power outages are rolling it means that major appliances are all but useless. And residents say right now, it’s local volunteers and groups that have stepped up while the government has, so far anyway, that help, mostly words, not yet deeds. There’s also increasing frustration about the response to the fire threat, warnings that were never heard or never seen.
