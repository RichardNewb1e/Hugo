We begin with the Labor Day travel rush in full swing. Americans are packing nationâ€™s airports and hitting the road to mark the unofficial end of summer. More than one hundred and forty-eight Americans will leave homes according to one survey, making this one of the busiest travel weekends of the year. While most of the Americans will be driving, the TSA said it expects more than fourteen million fires through Tuesday. AAA says today will be one of the worst days to get behind the wheel because it will be one of the busiest. The best day to drive will be Sunday, with little traffic expected. AAA also says the most popular destinations are Seattle, Orlando, Anchorage, New York City and Las Vegas. 

It has already been the busiest summer trave season on record and the TSA expects to get an 11% bump this Labor Day compare to last year. People flying today are finding very few cancelations but some weather related delays and there was some high flying drama overseas.
