This Juneteenth holiday weekend has begun with more than forty million Americans threaten by dangerous storms and blistering heat. Tonight, the greatest danger is from Oklahoma to Florida. Large hail, damaging winds and tornadoes are possible. The latest severe weather follows this scary scene, a waterspout on the Gulf Coast blew ashore in clearwater. Two people were hurt. And in Perryton, Texas, the cleanup is still ongoing after an EF3 tornado destroyed nearly everything in its path, killing three people. 

It's mid-June and it is acting like perhaps middle of May in terms of severe storms still rolling tonight and then tomorrow, Father’s Day, still rolling across parts of lower Mississippi Valley on towards the Gulf Coast, even into Florida here. The timing of this even before the sun comes up overnight, tomorrow morning, showers and thunderstorms are rolling across Oklahoma and Texas into Arkansas and Louisiana, into Mississippi and eventually Alabama, and more storms here across Florida as we head into your Father’s Day afternoon and evening time.
