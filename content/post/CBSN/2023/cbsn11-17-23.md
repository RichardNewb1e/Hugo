We begin tonight with the war in Gaza where Israeli troops conducted a floor-by-floor search inside Al Shifa hospital in Gaza for a third straight day. And airstrikes continue tonight on Hamas targets across the territory. The IDF says it recovered the body of a second female hostage who was kidnapped in the early hours of the October 7th attack. The nineteen-year-old Corporal was found near Gaza’s largest hospital. Tonight, CBSN has a rare look inside Al Shifa and a peek into the elaborate tunnel network dug underneath the building that Israel and the United States say has been used by Hamas. President B spoke on the phone with the leader of Qatar today whose country has relationship with Hamas to press him about the desperate need to release the hostages without further delay. 

Well, Israeli forces showed us what it said are quote, clear indications of a Hamas command center below Al Shifa hospital, an allegation that’s been central to Israel’s justification for its devastating military campaign across Gaza. It was under the cover of the darkness our journey into Gaza began. We traveled in one of Israel’s most sophisticated armored personnel carriers called the Nama or Tiger.
