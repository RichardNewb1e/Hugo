Tonight, disaster in central California in the wake of tenth atmosphere river to wash over the state this winter. A lot of breaches near the farming communities prompting widespread evacuations and dozens of water rescues. Record snowfall in Sierra is also causing new avalanche and landslide fears as the state goes from one weather extreme to another. 

It's called an atmosphere river, itâ€™s a storm slammed California and now there is a danger of not only the snowpack but surging runoff that could devastate the state and more. Racing to dig out as already overwhelmed mountain communities struggled with rain and snow melt that could destroy more homes. Central California bore the brunt of this storm. Further north, this is just one of at least dozen rivers overflowed with officials monitoring thirty more statewide. In San Francisco, the winds and rains costed a massive tree to crush several cars.
