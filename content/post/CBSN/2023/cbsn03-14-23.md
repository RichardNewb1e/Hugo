Tonight, the story-making international headlines, the first known physical confrontation between US and Russian military forces since the war in Ukraine began. A Russian fighter jet rammed a fifty-seven-million-dollar US drone, forcing it down. Plus, a new American college of cardiology study shows how much of good night sleep could have in your lifespan. But first, the intensified Nor’easter is slamming New England tonight about twenty three million Americans across twelve states are under a winter storm warning or advisory with some areas already getting more than two and a half feet of snow. Airports across the northeast in cities like New York and Boston are impacted with more than four thousand delayed flights and one thousand plus cancelations. Out west, nearly twenty seven thousand residents in California are under evacuation order during the flooding and landslide risks as the latest atmospheric river battered the state.
