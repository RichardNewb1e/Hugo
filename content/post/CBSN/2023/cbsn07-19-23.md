We begin tonight with dangerous weather griping the nation from brutally hot temperatures to life-threatening flooding and even tornadoes. This afternoon, a large twister touch-down in Rocky Mount, North Carolina, causing significant damage about fifty miles east of Raleigh. Roofs were ripped off home and trees and powerlines were scattered across roadways. Several people were transported to the hospital. And then from coast to coast, from Pasadena to Palm Beach, we’re talking about one hundred and twenty million Americans who are now under heat alerts. And torrential rains have flooded entire towns in western Kentucky, turning roads into rivers and forcing residents from their homes. 

The storm’s fury leaving a debris trail by some estimates, stretching two and a half miles wide. The tornado ripped through Pfizer manufacturing plant, shearing off the roof. In Dorchester, North Carolina, residential and ruined in stretches. Neighboring Kentucky worries, flooding.
