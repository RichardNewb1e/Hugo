Well, tonight, the B administration says it is considering all of its options after federal judge in Texas ignited a new national debate over abortion rights. His decision with suspend approval of a key abortion pill making the procedure harder to access even in states where it’s legal. 

Well, in addition to concerns about what the Texas judge’s decision could mean for women’s health, the B administration also says it undermines the FDA approval process which could impact other drugs that don’t have anything to do with abortion. The B administration is fighting back. Health and Human Services Secretary X.B is demanding the courts overturn a Texas judge’s ruling that would block access to the abortion pill Mifepristone, the medication used by women and more than half of all abortions across the country. Some Republicans also remain steadfast in their anti-abortion position despite losses in the midterms and in a recent Wisconsin Supreme Court race that virtually ensured that state’s abortion ban will be overturned.
