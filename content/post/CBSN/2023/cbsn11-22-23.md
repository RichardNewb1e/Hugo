Turning overseas now to the breakthrough deal between Israel and Hamas for the long-waited release of hostages. We are learning tonight that no hostages will be freed and until at least Friday. That’s what Hamas is expected to begin releasing fifty women and children in exchange for one hundred fifty Palestinian women and teenagers being held by Israel.  

Tonight, Israel’s Prime Minister B.N vowed to bring home all of the hostages calling it a sacred mission. Under the deal, Hamas is incentivized to release four of its captives. Every ten extra hostages freed will extend the temporary cease fire by a day. In Gaza, some residents told CBSN a four-day pause in fighting isn’t enough. In Israel, the families of the hostages have endured anxiety and heartbreak for more than six weeks, but with hope on the horizon, today a group of their supporters sang songs of peace in central Tel-Aviv. Israel’s military said tonight that the hostage release procedure has not yet been finalized. But one detail we do have is that the Red Cross will be able to visit those hostages who are not released and take them medicine.
