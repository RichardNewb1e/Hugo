Weâ€™ll bring you the latest on the migration situation at the southern border and across the country in a moment. First, this developing news, tonight, millions of Americans face weather extreme. What do we mean by that? A heat wave in the northwest, monsoon flooding in the southwest and the threat of tornadoes across the plains. The tornado threat was so real former President T canceled a rally schedule for tonight in Des Moines. Today in Texas, a twister left his damage in Laguna Heights near the border with Mexico. One person was killed, ten others hurt. Dozens twisters have touched down in four states over the last twenty-four hours. To the southern border now, where the surge of migrants, the B administration was braced for has not materialized. Still, tens of thousands of people are crowded in Mexico, hoping to enter the United States. Many arrived after perilous journeys only to find confusing new US asylum rules, balky technology and reinforced borders, this after Covid era border restrictions were lifted earlier this week.
