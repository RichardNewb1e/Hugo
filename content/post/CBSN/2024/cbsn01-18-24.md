In a devastating new report, the Department of Justice blames cascading failures of leadership, decision-making, tactics, policy and training for why police waited seventy-seven minutes before confronting the gunman at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde. Associate Attorney General V.G led the investigation. After reviewing over fourteen thousand pieces of data, more than two hundred and sixty interviews, the report lays much of the blame on then-school Police Chief P.A and his failure to treat it as an active shooter situation and not send all available resources toward the threat until entry was made into the classrooms. A. instead chose to evacuate other classrooms and wait for keys, backup and tools. A student from inside the classroom called 911 asking for help. An officer still waited nearly forty minutes before stopping the shooter. Only a handful of officers at the scene have lost their job or resigned. Since the Uvalde school shooting, districts across the country have reassessed their security protocols.
