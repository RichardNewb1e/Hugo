Tonight, millions of Americans from Montana to New Hampshire are enduring some of the coldest temperatures so far this winter. For many, a thaw is insight, the latest extreme weather in just a moment. But we begin tonight with the countdown of Tuesday’s first in the nation primary. Former South Carolina Governor N.H defending off attacks from her two main rivals as they worked to drive her from the race. Today, she questioned the mental fitness of front runner D.T.

Well, the temperature outside has dropped, but inside the heat is on between N.H and D.T as the former president looked to New Hampshire to solidify his path to the nomination. Competing in New Hampshire, D.T and N.H are questioning each other’s fitness for office. At the rally here, T confused H with N.P blaming her for security failures on January 6th. But T maintained the commanding lead in the polls here and he is rolling out key endorsements from H’s home state.

At T’s headquarter in Manchester, volunteers like R. are working the phones.
