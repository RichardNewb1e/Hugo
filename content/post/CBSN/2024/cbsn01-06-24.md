Tonight, the northeast is in the midst of the first big snowstorm of the season. A wintry mix is hitting the region, bringing snow, rain and icy roads. Up to a foot of snow is expected along a huge stretch of the East, from Pennsylvania to Maine. But first, we begin with the investigation into an Alaska Airlines jet had a section of its fuselage blow out mid-air. 

Now, the FAA is temporarily grounding and requiring immediate inspections of about 171 Boeing 737 Max 9 airplanes after that flightâ€™s plane lost a chunk of its shell in mid-air, forcing an emergency landing in Portland. Horror in the air as a plug door blew off this plane while it was 16000 feet in the sky. The 171 passengers and six crew members on board the aircraft Friday evening were headed to Ontario, California. Videos taken from inside the plane show passengers appearing calm. The plane had only been in service for a couple of months. Tonight, the FAA is ordering inspections of that airliner and dozens more like it. Alaska and United Airlines are the only US carriers that use 737 Max 9. Both airlines are warning passengers to expect delays as the planes go inspections.
