We do want to begin tonight with that breaking news. The United States beginning a series of retaliatory airstrikes on site. The White House said tonight that they have clear, irrefutable evidence is connected to the deadly drone attack that killed three soldiers in Jordan. The President’s national security spokesperson J.K saying tonight the strikes were successful but that the damage assessment will be done when the sun rises in the region. And this is just the beginning. The president saying the response will continue. Here is what we know. Three of the locations hit are in Iraq. Four are in Syria and there were dozens of individual targets within each site. The strike lasted thirty minutes involving multiple aircrafts. Those planes are now out of harm’s way. And it comes on the same day President B and the First Lady J.B were at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware for the dignified transfer of the remains of those fallen service members. We just returned from the Middle East where we were the first journalist to embed with the US Navy that saw the work being done firsthand to deter Iranian-backed troops from attacking American assets in the region.
