We begin our report on Capitol Hill, where not much is doing. The Senate failed to advance a bipartisan border policy and foreign aid package. Wednesdayâ€™s vote was mostly along party lines it would have set the stage for a floor debate on the measure but Senate Republicans were reluctant to move forward on a bill that House Republicans says has no chance of becoming law and so Congress has not addressed the issues. Negotiators spent months toiling over a southern border which saw a record number of migrants arrival in December. And support for Ukraine, which officials say Wednesday was hit by a Russian missile killing at least five people and wounding dozens more. 

As migrants continue to cross, Congress is frozen in place. A US Senate plan to stiffen border security, tighten requirements for asylum and nearly shutter the border during spikes of migrants crossing had the endorsement of Senate leaders and national border patrol union. But it collapsed in a vote late today in part because President T opposed it. The impasse is a blow also to cities like Chicago where A.B.L is helping the city respond to thousands of migrants bused from the border.
