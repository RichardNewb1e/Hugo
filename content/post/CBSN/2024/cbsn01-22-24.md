N.H is campaigning across New Hampshire like her political life depends on it. With Florida D.S now out of the race throwing his support behind D.T, H is scrambling to make up her double-digit deficit in the polls. At every stop today, H hoped to sway an undecided voter and for one independent we spoked with, it worked. New Hampshire GOP Chairman C.A says independent voters donâ€™t think alike. T is campaigning here after a detour to New York, where the E.J.C defamation trail was delayed when a juror fell sick and he is increasingly confident the nomination could be wrapped up by tomorrow. And then in New Hampshire the secretary of state is projecting record turnout in the Republican presidential primary expecting thirty-seven thousand more voters than in the last competitive GOP race in 2016. And rallies like behind me are aimed at turning every last vote. The Democratic National Committee had changed their primary calendar to prioritize South Carolina so B will not be on the ballot here in New Hampshire in the primary. So, Democrats are urging a write-in campaign.
