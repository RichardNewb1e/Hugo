We begin tonight with a story that’s impacting just about every state in America. The dangerous weather from not one but two major winter storms. The National Service today, saying forty-seven states are under weather alerts. We’re talking about deadly tornadoes in the south, blizzard conditions in the Midwest and here in the mid-Atlantic and Northeast, high-winds and heavy rain and floodings. Nearly two hundred and ten million American are in the path of this monster storm and parts of the northeast are under state of emergency. 

Parts of the Florida pan handle pummeled by a powerful tornado blasting through block after block, blowing apart buildings, shredding structures, and lifting homes off their foundation. Then the winds whipped north. Tonight, eighty-four million people are under flood watches and warnings along the east coast. In Baltimore, sandbags are helping protect low lying areas. And the Governor of New Jersey has declared a state of emergency.
