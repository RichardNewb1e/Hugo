### Apache
``` bash
httpd -k start -n Apache24

httpd -k stop -n Apache24
```

### Powershell
``` bash
powercfg /batteryreport
```

### Windows installation
When you reach the "Let's connect you to a network" screen during the Windows 11 installation, do not connect to any network.

Press Shift + F10 on your keyboard to open a Command Prompt window. (On some laptops, you might need to press Fn + Shift + F10.)

In the Command Prompt, type the following command exactly as it appears and press Enter:

Method 1: Using the OOBE\BYPASSNRO Command (Most Common)
``` bash
OOBE\BYPASSNRO
```

Method 2: Using start ms-cxh:localonly (For Newer Builds or if BYPASSNRO Fails)
``` bash
start ms-cxh:localonly
```
